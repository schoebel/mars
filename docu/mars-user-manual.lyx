\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical recommended usage is replication of multiple Logical Volumes (LVs)
 directly at bare metal (never inside of VMs), similar to DRBD:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/typical-mars-setup.fig
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
At the primary (active) side A, the applications are running.
 At each of the secondary (passive) sides B and C, only the underlying LV
 replicas are updated via the replication network traffic.
 The filesystem is not mounted at any secondary side, and the applications
 are not running there.
 However, the roles may be switched at any time, and then the application
 will for example run at Datacenter B in primary role, while the corresponding
 LV replicas will then be in secondary (passive) role at datacenters A and
 C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An advantage of multiple LV replication is that primary and secondary roles
 can be 
\series bold
\emph on
individually
\emph default
 switched at runtime
\series default
.
 For example, if you have 10 LVs in each of your servers, 6 LVs may currently
 run in datacenter A in primary role, while the other 4 LVs are running
 in datacenter B, while datacenter C is dimensioned for less CPU power,
 and is mainly intended for additional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emergency backup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replicas.
 For instance, such a 3-datacenter configuration may be used for load balancing
 during overload peaks, or for switchover due to kernel security updates,
 and much more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further setups are also possible.
 For example, you might replicate physical disks.
 However, this would be less flexible because your volumes must then uniformly
 run in the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 datacenter at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, MARS' replicated block devices may be exported via iSCSI or
 other protocols.
 Filesystems residing on top of MARS may be exported via NFS or glusterfs,
 etc.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The picture shows the flow of write requests.
 Let's start with the primary node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write requests directed at the virtual block device 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 are first buffered in a 
\emph on
temporary
\emph default
 kernel memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temporary kernel memory buffer serves multiple purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It keeps track of the 
\series bold
order
\series default
 of write operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, it keeps track of the positions in the underlying LV 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
.
 In particular, it detects when the same block is overwritten multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Writeback to the underlying LV may occur in a different order than submission
 order.
 On magnetic disk media, this may lead to a noticeable 
\series bold
performance boost
\series default
, as shown in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:IO-Performance-Tuning"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
During pending write operations, any concurrent reads from the same locations
 are served from the temporary memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the write has been buffered in the temporary memory buffer, the internal
 transaction logger kernel thread creates a so-called 
\emph on
log entry
\emph default
 and starts an

 operation on the transaction logfile.
 The log entry contains vital information such as the logical block number
 in the underlying LV, the length of the data, a timestamp, some header
 magic in order to detect corruption, the log entry sequence number, of
 course the data itself, and optional information like an MD5 checksum or
 compression information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the log entries

In order to reclaim the temporary memory buffer, its content must be written

 After writeback, the temporary space is freed.
 The writeback can do the following optimizations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
writeback may be in 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 order; in particular, it is 
\emph on
sorted
\emph default
 according to ascending sector ´numbers.
 This reduces the average seek distances of magnetic disks in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
when the same sector is overwritten multiple times, only the

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This usually happens 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the writeback to the underlying LV 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
 has started.
 Even when you power off the system right now, the information is not lost:
 it is present in the logfile, and will be reconstructed from there after
 restart from power loss (Recovery phase).
 This is similar to Recovery of database systems after unexpected power
 loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the primary node crashes during writeback, it suffices to replay
 the log entries from some point in the past until the end of the transaction
 logfile.
 It does no harm if you accidentally replay some log entries twice or even
 more often: since the replay is in the original total order.
 Thus any temporary inconsistency will be

In mathematics, the property that you can apply your logfile twice to your
 data (or even as often as you want), is called 
\series bold
idempotence
\series default
.
 This is a very desirable property: it ensures that nothing goes wrong when
 replaying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too much
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 / starting your replay 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too early
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Idempotence is even more beneficial: in case anything should go wrong with
 your data on your disk (e.g.
 IO errors), replaying your logfile once more often may even 
\series bold
heal
\series default
 some defects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

by logfile application.
 Good news for desperate sysadmins forced to work with old or flaky hardware!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of asynchronous replication by MARS is rather simple: just
 transfer the logfiles to your secondary nodes, and replay them onto their
 LV replica (aka copy of the disk data, aka mirror).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replay is always in the same write order as the total order defined by the
 primary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, a mirror of your data on any secondary may be outdated, but it
 always corresponds to some version which was valid in the past.
 This property is called 
\series bold
anytime consistency
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Your secondary nodes are always 
\series bold
strictly consistent
\series default
 in themselves.
 Notice that this kind of consistency is a 
\emph on
local
\emph default
 consistency model.
 At global level, MARS is 
\series bold
eventually consistent
\series default
.
 Strict global consistency is generally not possible over long distances.
 Reasons are (1) Einstein's law (speed of light), and (2) the CAP theorem
 and its sister theorems.
 The front-cover pictures showing the planets Earth and Mars tries to lead
 your imagination away from global consistency models, in order to prepare
 you mentally for local consistency as in

As you can see in the picture, the logfile transfer process is 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 from the replay process.
 Both processes can be switched on / off separately (see commands

\family typewriter

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 This may be 
\emph on
exploited
\emph default
: for example, you may replicate your logfiles as soon as possible (to protect
 against catastrophic failures), but deliberately wait one hour until it
 is replayed (under regular circumstances).
 If your data inside your filesystem 
\family typewriter

The State of MARS

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, MARS tries to 
\emph on
hide
\emph default
 any network failures from you as best as it can.
 After a network problem, any internal low-level socket connections are
 
\emph on
transparently
\emph default
 tried to re-open ASAP, without need for sysadmin intervention.
 In difference to DRBD, network failures will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 automatically alter the state of MARS, such as switching to 
\family typewriter
disconnected
\family default
 after a 
\family typewriter
ko_timeout
\family default
 or similar.
 From a high-level sysadmin viewpoint, communication may just take a very
 long time to succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the behaviour of MARS is different from DRBD, it is usually intended
 as a feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS is not only an 
\series bold
asynchronous
\series default
 system at block IO level, but also 
\series bold
at control level
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is 
\emph on
necessary
\emph default
 because in a widely distributed long-distance system running on slow or
 even temporarily failing networks, actions may take a long time, and there
 may be many actions

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

Synchronous concepts are generally not sufficient for expressing that.
 Because of inherent asynchronicity and of dynamic creation / joining of
 resources, it is neither possible to comprehensively depict a complex distribut

 state transition diagram

Probably it could be possible to formally model MARS as a Petri net.
 However, complete Petri nets are tending to become very conplex, and to

For almost double the cost per TiB, you can speed up write operations by

For much higher cost per TiB, typically by about a factor of 10, you can
 of course also use SSDs in place of HDDs.
 While relatively small-sized database workloads are nowadays typically
 on SSDs, big mass data is typically remaining on HDDs for cost reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, you should build more than one RAID set
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For low-cost storage, RAID-5 is no longer regarded safe for today's typical
 storage sizes, because the error rate is regarded too high.
 Therefore, use RAID-6.
 If you need more than 15 disks in total, create multiple RAID sets (each
 having at most 15 disks, better about 12 disks) and stripe them via LVM
 (or via your hardware RAID controller if it supports RAID-60).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 if you have more than 12 to 15 spindles in total.
 Therefore, the step-by-instructions of this manual will show you some examples
 with LVM striping over 2 physical volumes (PVs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LVM is highly recommended
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In principle, you may combine MARS with commercial storage boxes connected
 over Fibrechannel or iSCSI.
 At 1&1, there is not yet operational experience with such setups.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for maximum flexibility.
 When used in static space allocation mode (as opposed to thin provisioning
 mode), LVM involves no measurable overhead (within the measurement tolerances
 of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
).
 Although LVM thin provisioning could potentially save some cost, it may
 lead to massive performance degradation as observed with certain types
 of application behaviour.
 In order to stay at the safe side of operations, you should dimension your
 RAID storage size accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS' tolerance of networking problems comes with some cost.
 You will need some extra space for the transaction logfiles of MARS, residing
 at the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exact space requirements for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 depend on the 
\emph on
average write rate
\emph default
 of your application, not on the size of your data.
 An example: in 1&1 Shared Hosting Linux (ShaHoLin), we found that only
 few applications are writing more than 1 TB per day during ordinary
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Exception: restores from backup.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 operations.
 Most are writing even less than 100 GB per day, because the observed average
 filesystem data change rate is only about 1% per day
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Within some limits, the distribution is an exponential one, according to
 Zipf's law.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Of course, there exist other applications like backup where the write rate
 is much higher.
 Please try to determine your actual write rates from system tools like
 
\family typewriter
sar
\family default
.
 Usually, you want to dimension 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 such that you can survive a network loss lasting 3 days / about one weekend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be achieved rather easily, in one of the following ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Create an LV for 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 on top of your application VG, typically named 
\family typewriter
/dev/vg/mars
\family default
 or similar (see step-by-step instructions in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Setup-LVM"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is the easiest solution if you are anyway using LVM on top of a hardware
 BBU.
 This is also most flexible: it can be 
\series bold
resized during operation
\series default
.
 Therefore, you may start with a size of around 500 GiB, and later be extended
 with increasing demands.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This variant is also recommended if you have very expensive SSD storage.
 Depending on write rates, you could for example start with 100 GiB, and
 extend dynamically as far as needed, for example by some alerting scripts,
 or even using some cron job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Alternatively, you may use one 
\series bold
dedicated HDD
\series default
 with a capacity of 4 TB or more.
 Typically, this will provide you with plenty of headroom even for bigger
 networking incidents.
 Performace of a single HDD over a BBU is typically good enough for 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 because the transaction logs are involving mostly 
\emph on
sequential
\emph default
 reads and writes in larger chunks.
 However, there exist some workloads where striping could be necessary for
 maximizing sequential throughput.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Alternatively, if you are concerned about both performance and reliability,
 use two dedicated spindles over hardware RAID-1 with BBU.
 For maximum flexibility, put another VG on top of the dediactedRAID-1 set.
 For example, if 
\family typewriter
/dev/sdc
\family default
 is your RAID-1 set, create a PV and a VG called 
\family typewriter
mars
\family default
 on top of it.
 This is most flexible, since you might later migrate your 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 even during runtime, for example when replacing small disks with bigger
 ones, or when replacing HDDs with SSDs during runtime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For extemely high performance, separate SSD sets for the user data VG and
 for 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 might be beneficial.
 However, check whether it really pays off.
 Notice that a hardware BBU is nothing but a RAM cache, which is faster
 than any SSD, and there 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 some workloads where sequntial IO to HDDs is faster than to SSDs.
 Sometimes, there are hidden performance bottlenecks, such as SAS busses,
 or some old-generation RAID controllers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dedicated HDDs for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 have another advantage: their mechanical head movement is completely independen
t from your data head movements.
 For best performance, attach the corresponding disks to your hardware RAID
 controller with BBU, building a separate RAID set (even if it consists
 only of a single disk – notice that the 
\series bold
hardware BBU
\series default
 is the crucial point).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are concerned about reliability, use two disks configured as a relatively
 small RAID-1 set.
 For extremely high performance demands, you may consider (and check) RAID-10
 and/or SSD storage.
 However, SSDs are reported as less reliable.
 While failures of HDDs are typically detectable in advance by upcoming
 SMART media error counts, SSDs are typically failing suddenly and unexpectedly

 Like DRBD, the current version of MARS has

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

In addition, you should establish some regular monitoring of the free space

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Here is some more background information if you want to configure your system
 cronjob manually.
 In most installations, a 10 minute cron interval should be sufficient.
 Here is an example line, to be placed in a file like 
\family typewriter

\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is some background explanation about some internal intermediate steps,
 as executed by 
\family typewriter
marsadm cron
\family default
.
 The following is not needed for operations, but might be helpful for testing
 and debugging.
 You can skip it if you don't have much time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm log-rotate all
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This starts appending to a new logfile on all of your resources.
 The logfiles are automatically numbered by an increasing 9-digit logfile
 number.
 This will suffice for many centuries even if you would logrotate once a
 minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm log-delete-all all
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This determines all logfiles from all resources which are no longer needed
 (i.e.
 which are 
\emph on
fully
\emph default
 replayed, on 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 relevant secondaries).
 All superfluous logfiles are then deleted, including all copies on all
 secondaries.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MatieresCorrosives.png
	lyxscale 50

\end_inset

 The current version of MARS deletes either 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 replicas of a logfile everywhere, or 
\emph on
none
\emph default
 of the replicas.
 This is a simple rule, but has the drawback that one node may hinder other
 nodes from freeing space in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
.
 In particular, the command 
\family typewriter
marsadm pause-replay $res
\family default
 (as well as 
\family typewriter
marsadm disconnect $res
\family default
) will freeze the space reclamation in the whole cluster when the pause
 is lasting very long.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MatieresCorrosives.png
	lyxscale 50

\end_inset

 During such space accumulation, also the number of so-called deletions
 will accumulate in /mars/todo-global/ and sibling directories.
 In very big installations consisting of thousands of nodes, it is a good
 idea to regularly monitor the number of deletions similarly to the following:
 
\family typewriter
$(find /mars/ -name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete-*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 | wc -l)
\family default
 should not exceed a limit of ~150 entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please prefer the short form 
\family typewriter
marsadm cron
\family default
 as an equivalent to scripting two separate commands 
\family typewriter
marsadm log-rotate all
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
marsadm log-delete-all all
\family default
.
 The short form is not only easier to remember, but also future-proof in
 case some new MARS features should be added.

As a result, a directory

 will be created on hostA, containing some symlinks.
 hostA will automatically start in the primary role for this resource.
 Therefore, a new pseudo-device

 By default, MARS uses the so-called

 algorithm.
 It works similar to

rsync
\family default
, first reading the data on both sides and computing an md5 checksum for
 each block.
 Heavy-weight data is only transferred over the long-distance network upon
 checksum mismatch.
 This is extremely fast if your data is already (almost) identical on both
 sides.
 Conversely, if you know in advance that your initial data is completely
 different on both sides, you may choose to switch off the fast fullsync
 algorithm via

 checksum error in a transaction logfile, or another (hardware / filesystem)

 This occurs extremely rarely in practice, but has been observed more frequently

 Notice that a secondary

 Although this message is

 for the diskstate.
 A damaged transaction logfile will always affect the

 What to do in such a case?
\begin_inset Separator latexpar

\begin_deeper

When the damage is only at one of your secondaries, you should first ensure
 that the primary has a good logfile after a

\family default

\family default
 at the damaged secondary.
 It is crucial that the primary has a fresh correct logfile behind the error

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When 
\emph on
all

DefectiveLog
\family default
, the primary could have 
\emph on
produced
\emph default
 a damaged logfile (e.g.
 in RAM, in a DMA channel, etc) while continuing to operate, and all of
 your secondaries got that defective logfile.
 After 
\family typewriter
marsadm log-delete-all all
\family default
, you can check this by comparing the 
\family typewriter
md5sum
\family default
 of the first primary logfile (having the lowest serial number) with the
 versions on your replicas.
 The problem is that you don't know whether the primary side has a silent
 corruption on any of its disks, or not.
 You will need to take an operational decision whether to switchover to
 a secondary via 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default

\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
 your secondaries.

 Thus

MARS distinguishes between 
\emph on

\emph default
 and 
\emph on

 switching.
 This distinction is necessary due to the communication architecture (asynchrono
us communication vs synchronous communication, see explanation of Lamport
 Clock in 
\family typewriter

\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asynchronous communication means that (in worst case) a message may take
 (almost) arbitrary time in a distorted network to propagate to another
 node.
 As a consequence, the risk for accidentally creating an (unintended) split
 brain is increased (as compared to a synchronous system like DRBD).
\end_layout

In order to minimize this risk, MARS has invested a lot of effort into an
 internal handover protocol when you start an

 If some (parts of) logfiles are not yet (fully) transferred to the new

marsadm secondary

 It tells the

whole cluster
\emph default
 that 
\emph on
nobody

 is designated as primary anymore.
 
\emph on
All
\emph default
 nodes should go into secondary mode, globally.
 In the current version of MARS, the secondaries will no long fetch any
 logfiles, since in split brain situations they don't know which version
 is the

 one.
 When a primary host is designated, this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one by definition.
 Syncing is also not possible when there is no designated primary.
 When the device 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is in use somewhere, it will remain in 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 primary mode during that time, and the secondaries will sync therefrom.
 As soon as the local

\family default
 is released, the node will 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 go into secondary mode if it is no longer designated as primary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from losing the primary state.
 In case of an unexpected crash at the wrong moment, nobody might know anymore
 where the primary was running before.
 Best practice is to always switch 
\emph on
directly
\emph default
 from the old primary hostA to the new primary hostB.

 If you need the local device

\family default
 command.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm detach
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
marsadm down
\family default
 can do it also, without destroying knowledge about the former designated
 primary.
 There is only one use case where 
\family typewriter

In contrast to DRBD, MARS remembers the designated primary, even when your
 system crashes and reboots.
 With DRBD, you typically will have to re-setup the DRBD roles with (scripted)
 commands like 
\family typewriter
drbdadm up 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

; drbdadm primary 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset


\family default
.
 Instead, MARS will 
\series bold
automatically resume
\series default
 its former roles just by saying 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
.
 When combined with a proper 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 setup (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:systemd-Templates"

\end_inset

), this will even automatically re-start your application after the crash.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

Another fundamental difference to DRBD: when the network is healthy, there
 can only exist 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 designated primary at a time.
 By saying 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary mydata
\family default
 on host
\family typewriter
B
\family default
, 
\series bold
all other
\series default
 hosts (including 
\family typewriter
hostA
\family default
) will 
\series bold
automatically go into secondary role
\series default
 after a while.
 You don't need to tell them explicitly, because MARS is automatically propagati
ng the information for you.

 Planned handover is refused 
\emph on

\emph default
 when some sync is running somewhere, even at a third hostC.
 By adding the option 
\family typewriter
--ignore-sync
\family default
, you are no longer protected by this 
\emph on
safety measure
\emph default

Tip: newer versions of

\family typewriter
--parallel
\family default
 combined with

 Instead of waiting until 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the resources have left the primary role at the old primary (barrier synchoniza
tion), the handover speed of each resource is treated

 Slow resources will no longer retard fast ones, minimizing total downtime.
 However, check that your cluster manager can deal with a rather high parallelis

Some Background (may be skipped)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to DRBD, split brain situations are handled differently by MARS
 .
 When two primaries are accidentally active at the same time, each of them
 writes into different logfiles 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-hostA
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-hostB
\family default
 where the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 host is always recorded in the filename.
 Therefore, both nodes 
\emph on
can theoretically
\emph default
 run in primary mode independently from each other, at least for some time.
 They 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 even 
\family typewriter
log-rotate
\family default
 independently from each other.
 However, this is really no good idea.
 The replication to third nodes will likely get stuck, and your 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem(s) will eventually run out of space.
 Any further secondary node (when having 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 replicas) will certainly get into serious problems: it simply does not
 know which split-brain version it should follow.
 Therefore, you will certainly loose the actuality of your redundancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

 Split brain situations are detected 
\emph on
passively
\emph default
 by secondaries.
 Whenever a secondary detects that somewhere a split brain has happend,
 it refuses to replay any logfiles behind the split point (and also to fetch
 them when possible), or anywhere where something appears suspect or ambiguous.
 This tries to keep its local disk state always being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Beware: older versions before

 if your replica is a current sync target.
 This is not a bug: it should prevent you from forcing an inconsistent replica

 However, in extremely rare cases of severe damage of 
\emph on

 Only in such a rare case, and only then, you might decide to force any
 of your replicas (e.g.
 based on their last sync progress bar) into primary role although none
 of the re-syncs had finished before.
 In such a case, and only if you really know what you are doing, you may
 use

Newer versions of

\begin_layout Standard
You need LVM or some other means of increasing the physical size of your

 via firmware of some RAID controllers).
 The network must be healthy.
 Do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increase your local disks (usually

) 
\emph on
everywhere
\emph default
 in the whole cluster.
 In order to avoid wasting space, increase them 
\emph on

 For example, on both hostA and hostB:

 Check that sync is running, or has already finished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have intermediate layers such as iSCSI, you may need some

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Generally not needed, only for

extreme
\emph default
 safety / paranoia: you may wait until the partial sync has finished.
 This is not really needed, but it may 
\emph on
slightly(!)
\emph default
 reduce the risk in case of an unplanned incident at the primary side.
 If you execute the last step before the sync has finished, some data might
 have been already written to the new portions of the underlying LV.
 These writes will be written to the transaction log, and will be replicated.
 Thus there is no real danger, and your secondary will be 
\series bold

 If you want to avoid confusion about state

 by hardware defects at the wrong moment (although the transaction logfiles
 are already protected by md5 checksums), and/or if you are paranoid, it
 may be helpful to wait until the sync has finished.
 Normally, this is not needed, and you may immediately proceed to the last
 step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now you may increase your filesystem.
 This is specific for the filesystem type and documented elsewhere.
 Some filesystems are able to increase their size while they are mounted
 and while the applications are running on top of them, but others cannot
 do this.
 For example, an xfs online resize during operation can be triggered at
 primary hostA where

Hint: in general, the sync of the new portions is not really needed, because
 the new junk data just does not care at filesystem level.
 If you are not paranoid and if you know what you are doing, you may use

 for long-distance replication.
 If you want a system which can survive long-lasting network outages, while
 keeping your replicas consistent as long as possible (called 
\series bold
anytime consistency

\emph on
need
\emph default
 dynamic storage.

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bitmaps used by DRBD cannot preserve the

order
\emph default
 of write operations.
 They cannot do that, because their space is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(k)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, MARS preserves the order.
 Preserving the order as such (even when only 
\emph on
facts
\emph default
 about the order were recorded without recording the actual data contents)
 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 space where

 A true solution would need

 But suchalike does not exist on earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be an even worse idea to statically pre-allocate a lot of space
 for 
\emph on
each
\emph default

 The latter would waste a lot of space, because some resources will likely
 fill much more quickly than others.
 MARS deals with this by using a 
\emph on
common
\emph default
 filesystem /mars which is 
\emph on
shared
\emph default
 by the transaction logs of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of your resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the size of /mars is statically allocated at cluster generation
 time, there is a workaround for the problem.
 When 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 fills up during a network outage, and you have some spare space on your
 VG, and when the network outage will be repaired shortly, you may decide
 to dynamically extend /mars during operation.
\end_layout

 DRBD will be a suitable choice.
 However, if you need to replicate over longer distances, or if you need
 higher levels of reliability even when multiple failures may accumulate
 (such as network loss during a

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_maxdelay_ms
\family default
 Each request is delayed at most for this timespan.
 Smaller values will improve the responsiveness of your userspace application,
 but at the cost of potentially retarding the requests not sufficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_minwindow_ms
\family default
 Set the minimum length of the measuring window.
 The measuring window is the timespan for which the average (throughput)
 rate is computed (see 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_rate_kb
\family default
).
 Lower values can increase the responsiveness of the controller algorithm,
 but at the cost of accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_maxwindow_ms
\family default
 This parameter must be set sufficiently much greater than 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_minwindow_ms
\family default
.
 In case the flow of throttled operations pauses for some natural reason
 (e.g.
 switched off, low load, etc), this parameter determines when a completely
 new rate calculation should be started over
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Motivation: if requests would pause for one hour, the measuring window could
 become also an hour.
 Of course, that would lead to completely meaningless results.
 Two requests in one hour is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incorrect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from a human point of view: we just have to ensure that averages are computed
 with respect to a reasonable maximum time window in the magnitude of 10s.

\begin_layout Standard
This section explains some implementation details.
 You may skip it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 is almost full and there is really absolutely no chance of getting rid
 of any local transaction logfile (or free some space in any other way),
 there is only one exit strategy: stop creating new logfile data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the ability for replication gets lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering emergency mode, the kernel module will execute the following
 steps for all resources where the affected host is acting as a primary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logrotate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but create a 
\emph on
hole
\emph default
 in the sequence of transaction logfile numbers.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logfile is left empty, i.e.
 no data is written to it (for now).
 The hole in the numbering will prevent any secondaries from replaying any
 logfiles behind the hole (should they ever contain some data, e.g.
 because the emergency mode has been left again).
 This works because the secondaries are regularly checking the logfile numbers
 for contiguity, and they will refuse to replay anything which is not contiguous.
 As a result, the secondaries will be left in a consistent, but outdated
 state (at least if they already were consistent before that).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kernel module writes back all data present in the temporary memory buffer
 (see figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Transaction-Logger"

\end_inset

).
 This may lead to a (short) delay of user write requests until that has
 finished (typically fractions of a second or a few seconds).
 The reason is that the temporary memory buffer must not be increased in
 parallel during this phase (race conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the temporary memory buffer is empty, all local IO requests (whether
 reads or writes) are directly going to the underlying disk.
 This has the same effect as if MARS would not be present anymore.
 Transaction logging does no longer take place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Any sync from any secondary is stopped ASAP.
 In case they are resuming their sync somewhen later, they will start over
 from the beginning (position 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to leave emergency mode, the sysadmin should do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Free enough space.
 For example, delete any foreign files on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 which have nothing to do with MARS, or resize the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem, or whatever.
\end_layout

\end_layout

Notice: as long as not enough space has been freed, a message containing
 
\family typewriter

\family default
 (or similar) will be displayed by 
\family typewriter

 As a consequence, any sync will be automatically halted.
 This applies to freshly invoked syncs also, for example created by 
\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the secondaries, use

 in order to request updating your outdated mirrors.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As soon as emough space has been freed everywhere to leave the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Recommendation: check at secondaries that state 
\family typewriter
Orphan
\family default
 has been left after a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, there is a more complicated method, which keeps more intermediate
 emergency backup replicas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of your secondaries hostX:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
marsadm leave-resource mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the primary hostA:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
marsadm cron
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait until 
\family typewriter
df /mars
\family default
 shows no longer an overflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the first secondary hostB:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource mydata /dev/lv/mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait until sync has finished at hostB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have more than 2 replicas in total: proceed with step 4 at hostC,
 and so on.
 This time, you could join multipe resources in parallel, because you already
 have a life replica at hostB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Expert advice, if you have only 2 replicas, and provided you have enough
 VG space: analogously to paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "par:Retaining-a-Split"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 you may use 
\family typewriter
lvrename
\family default
 for keeping an outdated emergency backup before creating a new LV with
 the old name, and before re-joining the latter.
 Don't forget to remove your backup LV after sync has finished!

This option does not change the internal waiting logic for thois commands
 which emulate synchronous behaviour on top of the asynchronous communication
 paradigm.
 Many commands are waiting until the desired effect has succeeded.
 However, with

 the desired effect will never happen, so the command may wait forever (or
 abort with a timeout).

 This tries to retrieve preliminary information as best as possible.

Reason: 
\family typewriter
leave-cluster
\family default
 removes only its 
\emph on
own
\emph default
 IP address from 
\family typewriter
/mars/ips/
\family default
, but does not destroy the usual symmetry of the symlink tree by leaving
 the other IPs intact.
 Therefore, the local node will continue fetching updates from all nodes
 present in 
\family typewriter
/mars/ips/
\family default
.
 As an effect, the local node will 
\emph on
passively
\emph default
 mirror the symlinks of other cluster members, but not vice versa.
 There is no communication from the local node to the other ones, turning
 the local node into a 
\series bold
whitness
\series default
 according to some terminology from Distributed Systems.
 This is a feature, not a bug.
 It could be used for porst-mortem analysis, or for monitoring purposes.
 However, 
\emph on
deletions
\emph default
 of symlinks are not guaranteed to take place, so your whitness may 
\emph on
accumulate
\emph default
 thousands of old symlinks over a long time.
 If you want to eventually stop all communication to the local node, just
 run

 passivley fetching the symlink tree.
 In order to really stop all communication, the kernel module should be
 unloaded afterwards (rmmod mars).
 The local 
\family typewriter

 for decommissioning of hardware.
 This is receommended for preventing

In case of an unintended hardware destruction (e.g.

 you want to remove (e.g.

\emph on
ensure
\emph default
 that it cannot be accidentally re-used in any way (e.g.
 physical destruction of the underlying RAID, 
\family typewriter
lvremove
\family default

 On all other hosts, do

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of executing 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands serveral times for each resource argument, you may give the special
 resource argument 
\family typewriter
all
\family default
.
 This work even when combined with 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
, but be cautious when giving dangerous command combinations like 
\family typewriter
marsadm delete-resource --force all
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In newer versions of 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
, you may give a comma-separated list of resource names in place of 
\family typewriter
all
\family default
.
 This way, you have more fine-grained control over the set of resource names
 you want to use.

Beware when combining this with

--host=somebody
\family default
.
 In some very rare cases, like final destruction of a whole datacenter after
 an earthquake, you might need a combination like

 Don't use such combinations if you don't need them

 DANGEROUS!

\size scriptsize
Use this only in desperate situations, and only manually.
 Don't call this from scripts.
 You are forcefully using a sledgehammer, even without 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
! The danger is that the 
\emph on
true
\emph default
 state of other cluster nodes cannot be known in general, e.g.
 network problems etc.
 Even when it were known, it could be compromised by 
\series bold
byzantine failures

\size scriptsize
It is strongly advised to try this command with 
\family typewriter
--dry-run

 first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When combined with 
\family typewriter
--force

\series bold
murder

 other cluster nodes, possibly after a long while, and even when they are
 operating in primary mode / having split brains / etc.
 However, there is no guarantee that other cluster nodes will be 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 dead – it is (theoretically) possible that they remain only 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 
\emph on
dead
\emph default

 For example, a half dead node may continue to write data to 
\family typewriter

This command implies a forceful detach, possibly destroying consistency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
It is similar in spirit to 
\series bold
STONITH
\series default
, but on cluster level, affection all known resource members.
 In particular, when a cluster node was operating in primary mode (
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 being continuously in use), the forceful detach cannot be carried out until
 the device is completely unused.
 In the meantime, the current transaction logfile will be appended to, but
 the file 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be already unlinked (orphan file filling up the disk).
 After the forceful detach, the underlying disk need not be consistent (although
 MARS does its best).
 Since this command deletes any symlinks which normally would indicate the
 consistency state, no guarantees about consistency can be given after this
 
\emph on
in general
\emph default
! Always check consistency by hand!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When possible / as soon as possible, check the local state on the other
 nodes in order to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 shutdown the resource everywhere (e.g.
 to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 unuse the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
After this command, you 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 rebuild the resource under a different name, in order to avoid any clashes
 caused by unexpected resurrection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 zombie nodes (beware of shapshot / restores on virtual machines!!).
 MARS does its best to avoid problems even in case the new resource name
 should equal the old one, but there can be 
\emph on
no guarantee
\emph default
 in all possible failure scenarios / usage scenarios.

In contrast to DRBD, you need not explicitly pause syncing, fetching, or
 replaying 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 (as apposed to 
\emph on
from
\emph default
) the local disk.
 These processes are automatically paused.
 Another difference to DRBD: the fetch / replay processes etc will usually
 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 resume after re-attach, as far as possible in the respective new situation.
 This will usually work even over 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 or reboot cycles, since the internal symlink tree will automatically persist
 all todo switches for you (c.f.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Notice: only

 transfer operations 
\emph on
to

 the local disk are paused by a detach.
 When another node is remotely running a sync 
\emph on
from
\emph default
 your local disk, it will likely remain in use for remote reading.
 The reason is that the server part of MARS is operating purely passively,
 in order serve all remote requests as best as possible (similar to the
 original Unix philosophy).
 In order to really stop all accesses, do a 
\family typewriter
pause-sync
\family default
 on all other resource member where a sync is currently running.
 You may also try 
\family typewriter
pause-sync-global

\size scriptsize
Note: although this sounds similar to DRBD's 
\family typewriter
drbdadm connect
\family default
, there are subtle differences.
 DRBD has exactly one connection per resource, which is associated with
 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of nodes.
 In contrast, MARS may create multiple connections per resource at runtime,
 and these are associated with the 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 host (not with 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of hosts).
 As a consequence, the fetch may 
\emph on
potentially
\emph default
 occur from any other source host which happens to be reachable (although
 the current implementation prefers the current designated primary, but
 this may change in future).
 In addition, 
\family typewriter
marsadm disconnect
\family default
 does not stop 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 communication.
 It only stops fetching logfiles.
 The symlink updates running in background (default port 7777) are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 stopped, in order to always propagate as much metadata as possible throughout
 the cluster.
 In case of a later incident, chances will be higher for a better knowledge
 of the 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 state of the cluster.

There are three variants:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Variant 1: planned handover (no 
\family typewriter

\family default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
Precondition: sync must have finished at any resource member.
 All relevant transaction logfiles must be either already locally present,
 or be fetchable (see 
\family typewriter
marsadm up
\family default
, or low-level commands 
\family typewriter
resume-fetch
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
resume-replay
\family default
).
 When some logfile data is locally missing, there must be enough space on
 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 to fetch it.
 Any replay must not have been interrupted by a replay error (see macro
 %replay-code{} or diskstate 
\family typewriter
DefectiveLog
\family default
).
 The current designated primary must be reachable over network.
 When there is no designated primary (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm secondary
\family default
 had been executed before, which is explicitly 
\emph on
not recommended
\emph default
), at least the old primary must be reachable.
 The (old) primarie's virutal device 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 must not be in use any more (see 
\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount
\family default
).
 A split brain must not already exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
Postcondition: the current host is in primary role; 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/$dev_name
\family default
 appears locally and is usable; the equivalent of

Description of the

Handover

 is not given): when another host is currently primary, it is first asked
 to leave its primary role.
 When systemd templates are active, this will be automatically triggered
 via 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop $stop_unit
\family default
.
 Otherwise, you are resposible for stopping the load yourself, and you dhoulf
 use 
\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount
\family default
 in advance for checking.
 Anyway, the handover procol s waiting until the former primary has actually
 become secondary.
 After that, the local host is requested to become primary.
 Before actually becoming primary, all relevant logfiles are transferred
 over the network and replayed, in order to avoid accidental creation of
 split brain as best as possible

best effort

 network outages.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Only after that, 
\family typewriter

 impossible), this command may take a very long time.

A common misconception is when people think that they can keep their filesystem
 mounted without provoking a split brain, because they have their application
 stopped and thus don't write any data into the filesystem.
 This is a wrong idea, because filesystems may write some metadata, like
 booking information, even after hours or days of inactivity.
 Therefore MARS insists that the device is no longer in use before any handover
 can take place.

 In some extremely rare cases, when

 In split brain situations, or if you ever encounter such a problem, you

 replicas:

 cannot resolve a split brain at

 Therefore, prefer the

\family default
 method described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Split-Brain-Resolution"

\end_inset

, starting with a

leave-resource
\family default
 phase at the old primary, and proceeding to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unrelated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 secondaries step by step, until the split brain is gone.
 Don't 
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
 again before the split brain is gone! This way, all these replicas will
 remain consistent for now, but of course outdated (or potentially even
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 split-brain version, but 
\emph on
potentially usable
\emph default
 in case you get under pressure in some way).
 In the hopefully unlikely case that you should later discover that you
 accidentally forced the 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 replica via 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
, you will have a chance for recovery by either forcing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 host to primary (if it did not already leave the resource), or by creating
 a completely fresh resource out of the

 Generally: in case of

primary --force
\family default
, the preconditions are different.
 The fetch 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be switched off (see 
\family typewriter
pause-fetch

 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 For your safety, 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
 does not work in newer marsadm (after mars0.1stable52) when your replica
 is a current sync target.

 In split brain situations (when the network is OK again), this may have

For scripting, these commands are often needed for race avoidance.
 MARS' symlink are not propagated 
\emph on
immediately
\emph default

eventually consistent

 The following commands can be used for triggering a status update, and

 and a load which has been captured from a

\series default
 (1&1 Ionos ShaHoLin = Shared Hosting Linux).
 The load already contains a parallelism degree of 20 LXC containers running
 in parallel at the same iron.
 This corresponds to about 60,000 web spaces running on 20 Apache instances,
 already in parallel.
 In difference to artificial benchmarks (like pure random IO or pure sequential

 All data, including the

We start with the 
\series bold
raw
\series default
 device 
\family typewriter
/dev/vginfong/lv-0
\family default
 which had a size of 8 TiB.
 The throughput is about 1418 IOPS, and the latency diagram shows that the
 system is overloaded, but can cope with that overload: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/blkreplay/MARS.MARS.raw.iosched-noop.nr_request-128.icpu5133.vginfong.lv-0.g01.latency.realtime.png
	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
As you can see in the filename, the NOOP kernel IO scheduler was used, and
 the kernel parameter 
\family typewriter
nr_requests
\family default
 was left at its default value of 128.
 When you read the specs of the Dell R730 hardware RAID controller, you
 will notice that it can handle a much higher IO request parallelism of
 almost 1024 requests in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the first natural tuning attempt is 
\family typewriter
nr_requests=1020
\family default
, in order to release the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kernel IO handbrake
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This results in an improved throughput of 1562 IOPS, and even the 
\emph on
maximum
\emph default
 latencies are improved, but the 
\emph on
average
\emph default
 latencies are becoming a little bit worse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

	width 100col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
It is well known since decades that there is a principal tradeoff between
 throughput and latencies in IO systems.
 Thus it is not a surprising result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On servers, overload situations should be rare, and during overload throughput
 is typically much more important than latencies, as long as latencies are
 not exceedingly high.
 Thus we can recommend 
\family typewriter
nr_requests=1000
\family default
 for production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, some sysadmins might be tempted to question why the NOOP scheduler
 has been used.
 On the internet, there are a ton of claims that other IO schedulers like
 CFQ are much better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, testing with CFQ instead of NOOP is no problem for 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
.
 However, the result is very surprising.
 While the IOPS are 1539, which is only a slight decrease which could result

In production, you should never encounter IO latencies of almost 15 seconds.
 So what is going wrong here?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an explanation.
 A hardware RAID controller 
\emph on
already
\emph default
 has an 
\emph on
internal
\emph default
 IO scheduler.
 This IO scheduler is hidden in a black box, such that many sysadmins don't
 know of its existence.
 If you add another IO scheduler at kernel level, you will have 
\series bold
two different
\series default
 IO schedulers running in parallel, and sometimes taking 
\series bold
contradictory decisions
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These contradictory IO scheduling decisions may lead to problems in certain
 cases and scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another risk of interference with a third IO scheduler, which is
 MARS' internal asymmetric writeback scheduler.
 The latter is currently well-tuned for co-working with a BBU cache and
 its internal scheduler, running on bare metal.

 Never use MARS inside of VMs! There you will have 
\emph on
several
\emph default
 additional IO schedulers and further types of IO bottlenecks
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Example: data container formats like 
\family typewriter
qcow2
\family default
 can act as serious bottlenecks.
 Never place 
\family typewriter
/mars
\family default
 on top of them! Potential exceptions (after well-founded investigations)
 are functional testing, and certain non-critical workstation-like workloads.
 In general, never plan to place unknown or enterprise-critical workloads
 on top of them!
\end_layout

\end_inset

 inbetween, even if you try to disable some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While kernel-level IO schedulers like CFQ certainly have their merits at
 improving your workstation's IO behaviour, they are counter-productive
 at servers with hardware RAID controllers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the advice is clear: 
\series bold
switch them off
\series default
 
\emph on
in such a case
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if you have a software RAID, check with

 Notice that device driver restrictions like

Now we come to benchmarking

/dev/vginfong/lv-0

\begin_layout Standard
So you might expect that performace of

\family default
 could be worse than at the underlying raw device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the

throughput
\series default
 is now measured 4338 IOPS, which means that performance has

 You can also see it by the duration of the benchmark at the x axis.
 Even the latencies have improved in many cases:

 The key to local IO performance is the 
\series bold
re-ordering of writeback
\series default
 according to ascending sector numbers.
 This can reduce mechanical seek times of hard disks considerably, and even
 by factors, such that it can over-compensate the doubled writes to the
 transaction logfile, and even when both are residing at the same RAID set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since RAID-6 is has more expensive write operations due to its CRC computations
 and updates, RAID-6 will much more profit from this effect.
 Other RAID modes like RAID-10 may show a lower throughput improvement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice: this effect is not only dependent from total RAM size and from the
 maximum size of the MARS temporary memory buffer (tuning parameter 
\family typewriter
/proc/sys/mars/mars_mem_percent
\family default
 which defaults to a limit of 20%).
 It is also highly dependent from the actual seek behaviour of the 
\series bold
workload
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you use 
\family typewriter
dd
\family default
 for sequentially overwriting /dev/mars/lv-0 with a parallelism degree of
 1, the writeback optimization of MARS cannot be exploited.
 However, 
\family typewriter
dd
\family default
 is no appropriate benchmarking tool, and has almost nothing to do with
 real workloads occuring in datacenters, which typically are neither sequential,
 nor do they have a parallelism degree of only 1.

 Please don't try to lead any discussions about this: simply use

 to capture your real server workload, and compare it to a run of dd.
 Only if you encounter the same behaviour as

 There no substitute for real measuments of

 However, as a major drawback, this may slow down the IO latencies of writes
 considerably, and thus may drastically reduce local IO performance (depending
 on performance of your crypto hardware, and on compressibility of data,
 etc).
 In particular, ZLIB is known to be a very slow algorithm (but to compress
 somewhat better than others), while LZO is a very old but very fast algorithm.
 In many cases, LZO or LZ4 are preferable.
 Do not enable this option blindly.

Notice that the uplinks of the two servers are only 1 GBit/s respectively.
 When the uplink is saturated, about 100 MByte/s is the maximum possible
 peak throughput in theory.
 You can easily recognize that the peak throughput is almost reached with
 a parallelism degree of 2, but using even more sockets appears to be slightly
 counter-productive.
 One of the reasons is that more sockets will increase contention on the
 line, and thus increasing packet loss.
 Another potential reason is that higher parallelism at sockets will lead
 to higher parallelism in disk reads, in turn leading to more permutations
 of disk read positions (more 
\emph on

 reads instead of purely sequential reads), which is counter-productive
 for disk readahead strategies.

 By default, this is set to -1 in order to switch off perment logging completely.
 Permament logging can easily flood your syslog with such huge amounts of

The rationale behind flood protected syslogging: sysadmins are usually only
 interested in the point in time where some problems / incidents / etc have
 
\emph on
started
\emph default
.
 They are usually not interested in capturing 
\emph on
each

If you

\emph default
 need complete error information, use the 
\family typewriter
*.log
\family default
 files described above, compress them and save them to somewhere else 
\emph on

 by a cron job.
 This bears much less overhead than filtering via the syslog daemon, or
 even remote syslogging in real time which will almost surely screw up your
 system in case of network problems co-inciding with flood messages, such
 as caused in turn by those problems.
 Don't rely on real-time concepts, just do it the old-fashioned batch job
 way.

 If logfile replay would be paused for the full duration of very large or
 long-lasting syncs (which could take some days over very slow networks),
 your

 Therefore, MARS regulary flips between actually syncing and actually replaying,

 Public Internet service and transit providers do not necessarily treat

Why

systemd
\family default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All major Linux distributions are now 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 based.
 It is the new quasi standard.
 Although there have been some discussions in the OpenSource community about
 its merits and its shortcomings, now it appears to be accepted in large
 parts of the Linux world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systemd has a few advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is running as 
\family typewriter
init
\family default
 process under the reserved 
\family typewriter
pid=1
\family default
.
 If it ever would die, then your system as a whole would die.
 There is no need for adding yet another MARS clustermanager daemon 
\family typewriter
marsd
\family default
 or similar, which could fail 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
 from other parts of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Although 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 has been criticised as being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monolithic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (referring to its internal software architecture), its 
\emph on
usage
\emph default
 by sysadmins is easily decomposable into many plugins called 
\series bold
\emph on
units
\series default
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Local LXC containers, local VMs, 
\family typewriter
iSCSI
\family default
 exports, 
\family typewriter
nfs
\family default
 exports and many other parts of the system are often already controlled
 by 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
.
 Together with 
\family typewriter
udev
\family default
 and other parts, it already controls devices, LVM, mountpoints, etc.
 Since MARS is only a particular 
\emph on
component
\emph default
 in a bigger complicated stack, it is an advantage to use the same (more
 or less standardized and well-integrated) tools for managing the whole
 stack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Personal experience: the 
\series bold
unit dependency engine
\series default
 of systemd is extremely elaborated
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The author misses only one feature: a new dependency type, or an object
 type like a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and useful.
 Management of complex transitive dependencies is relatively easy (though
 not always fully intuitive).
 Writing your own dependency engine would be a huge effort, which can be
 saved by just using standard systemd and learning how to configure it properly
 for your applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the opinion of of author, systemd also has a few disadvantages, such
 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is not 
\series bold
accepted
\series default
 everywhere.
 Therefore the 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 template extensions of

 are 
\emph on
not mandatory
\emph default
 for MARS operations.
 You can use or implement your own alternatives when necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Interfacing to 
\series bold
third-party software
\series default
 may become hairy.
 systemd appears to assume that more or less 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
 is controlled by systemd.
 Pre-existing software would sometimes need to be adapted to systemd, but
 this isn't always possible in practice.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
systemd-notify
\family default
 assumes that you can alter some third-party-controlled executables or complex
 third-party systems, which often isn't easily possible in practice
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The problem is that 
\family typewriter
systemd-notify
\family default
 needs to be inserted into the 
\emph on
control flow
\emph default
 of your third-party software.
 This doesn't work if your third-party software doesn't have the right hooks
 in the right places, or when there exists no local control flow at some
 (failure) conditions.
 Therefore, any status inquiry would need to be configurable at systemd
 units, not by any modifications of third-party software.
 Unfortunately, the current systemd does not have appropriate features like
 
\family typewriter
ExecCheckState=/my/state-reporting-script.pl
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
.py
\family default
 or similar.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sometimes it can be

messy
\series default
 to deal with.
 In particular, it can sometimes 
\emph on
believe
\emph default
 that some parts of the system

\emph default
 in a particular state, although in reality they aren't.
 The current version of systemd lacks an important property called

Idempotence
\series default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In industrial automation and control, it is quite standard that you specify
 the

desired target state

, without having to obey the current state.
 For example, if a big fan or a big pump is already running, or if a valve
 is already open, there will be no error if somebody tries to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 it (for whatever reason, or when induced from a higher level in the control
 hierarchy).
 Unfortunately, 
\family typewriter
systemctl

 often reports an error code if you try to start a unit when it is currently
 running, or when it 
\emph on
believes
\emph default
 that it 
\emph on

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to 
\family typewriter
man sd_notify
\family default
, there exists a clearly defined message type 
\family typewriter
STOPPING=1
\family default
, but I cannot find a clearly defined and reliable equivalent of STOPPED=1
 for reporting that the unit has actually completed the stopping, and that
 now it is actually (re-)startable (again).
 Notice that some third-party software needs some external preconditions
 to be met before it can be started.
 From the 
\family typewriter
sd_notify
\family default
 docs, it is unclear to me whether 
\family typewriter
ERRNO=0
\family default
 could be 
\emph on
misused
\emph default
 for such a report.
 By reading some systemd sourcecode, I cannot easily tell, because the internal
 state model of systemd appears to be extremely complex, and the message
 passing model looks even more complex, like a huge finite state automaton
 with additional non-trivial transitional conditions.
 Semantically unspecified generic messages like STATUS=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

freetext_message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot not help me for achieving a clearly defined and reliable behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that some third-party software does not use long-running daemons
 at all, or only in certain places.
 Then messages like 
\family typewriter
MAINPID=
\family default
 are not useful at all.
 There exist use cases where 
\series bold
dynamic polling of actual state
\series default
 would be a very simple and easy solution in place of a complex state-keeping
 / state transition / message passing model, for example a new unit directive
 like 
\family typewriter
ExecCheckState=/my/state-reporting-script.pl
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
.py
\family default
 or similar.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 MARS can workaround these shortcomings via a pseudo unit type 
\family typewriter
.script
\family default
 which allows you to directly call some (wrapper) scripts, or to write some

 to third-party software.

This architecture looks somewhat complicated, but it was found to be necessary
 to assure lockless parallel starting and stopping of multiple resources
 without conflicts.
 Apparently, systemd is not a fully asynchronous system, while a Distributed
 System (like the MARS replication) is always a fully asynchronous system
 by its very nature.
 The above triggers are used to translate from the fully asynchronous Distribute
d System to the less asynchronous systemd execution model.

systemd already has some basic templating capabilities.
 It is possible to create unit names containing the

 However, automatic expansion is only done when somebody knows the instance

 The author has not found any way for creating instance names out of

 This is necessary for distinction of both layers.
 Notice that variables defined via the macro processor syntax

, the backslash will be removed.
 Therefore, don't forget to either replace any single backslash with two
 backslashes, or to put the whole pathname in single quotes, or similar.
 Always check the result of your substitutions! It depends on the 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 (such as 
\family typewriter
bash

\begin_layout Quote
Exactly one hash symbol exactly at the start of the line, optionally followed
 by whitespace, followed by the marker in CAPITAL letters.
\end_layout

Howto use .script
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a template name ends in 
\family typewriter
.script
\family default
 and has execute permissions, the marsadm template generator will write
 the instantiated script (with all 
\family typewriter
@{...}
\family default
 variables substituted) into the directory 
\family typewriter
/etc/marsadm/systemd-generated/
\family default
 directory in place of 
\family typewriter
/run/systemd/systemd/
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In place of 
\family typewriter
systemctl start $unit
\family default
, the script 
\family typewriter
/etc/marsadm/systemd-generated/$unit.script start
\family default
 is called with single parameter 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
, and similarly for 
\family typewriter
stop
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way, the author found it easy to program idempotent scripts, like adaptors
 to third-party software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Motivation for .script
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author has spent a lot of time (several months) for getting standard
 systemd units to work in a fully asynchronous Distributed System consisting
 of hundreds of machines, where 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 type of event may appear at 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this big effort resulted in a somewhat working system, the result
 is was not fully HA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that HA is defined by a single number like 99.99% (see mars-architecture-g
uide.pdf).
 In practice, true HA 
\emph on
typically
\emph default
 means that the 
\emph on
total system
\emph default
, including its controlling components, must be 
\series bold
more reliable
\series default
 than (some or any) of its worker sub-components.
 Notice that systemd is one one of these components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with systemd was that it created failures on its own.
 Compensation of these failures became very hairy with the current version,
 as used for the experiments (Debian Buster).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apparently, systemd does not tolerate certain types of parallelism.
 For example, while 
\family typewriter
systemd daemon-reload
\family default
 is currently executing, a parallel 
\family typewriter
systemctl start $other_unit
\family default
 may fail, although it normally works without problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more unfortunate, sometimes systemd did no longer know the 
\emph on
actual state
\emph default
 of a unit, as the following example output snippet from 
\family typewriter
systemctl status mnt-test-lv
\backslash
x2d0.mount
\family default
 is demonstrating:

\begin_layout Standard
This failure report was wrong, because the mount had actually succeeded
 in reality, but systemd wrongly assumed the opposite.
 Neither 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 nor 
\family typewriter
stop
\family default
 was possible afterwards, even after 
\family typewriter
systemctl reset-failed
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibly this may be a bug, which could be fixed.
 However, HA systems are expected to even work in the presence of bugs,
 as best as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you ever encounter a similar problem, you may get stuck in a dead end,
 at least for a while.
 Apparently, systemd is repairing the state of failed mount units after
 some timeout, but in the meantime true HA with many nines is endangered.
 Other unit types appear to show similar failure behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the reason for this behaviour?

\emph on
attempt
\emph default
 to analyze the problems at 
\emph on
concept level
\emph default
, and to suggest some solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following may be of interest for systemd developers, and for very advanced
 users of systemd.
 All others may skip the rest of this paragraph, and just use the 
\family typewriter
.script
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From observation, and from 
\family typewriter
man systemctl
\family default
 it appears to me that a 
\family typewriter
systemctl
\family default
 command invocation (aka job) is not fully equivalent to an 
\family typewriter
ExecStart=
\family default
 directive.
 According to the docs, 
\family typewriter
Exec=
\family default
 and some sister directives are obeying dependencies to any queued or already
 running jobs.
 However, I found no obvious way for obeying dependencies when starting
 jobs via 
\family typewriter
systemctl
\family default
 commands 
\emph on
manually
\emph default
.
 There is an option 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=
\family default
 which defaults to the value 
\family typewriter
replace
\family default
, documenting the bad behaviour I have observed: it may 
\series bold
\emph on
disturb
\series default
\emph default
 a currently running or conflicting job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In worst case, the conflicting unit may fail 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unexpectedly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from a user's viewpoint due to the default 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=replace
\family default
, and I have observed cases where it was neither startable nor stoppable
 immediately afterwards (maybe this could depend on further properties of
 called 
\family typewriter
Exec=
\family default
 scripts, which may stem from a third party, and are not constructed for
 being called by systemd: eventually I got desperate after investing a lot
 of time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusions: there appear multiple non-trivial HA problems with the current
 version of systemd.
 While some of them may be bugs which could be fixed, others appear to reside
 at 
\emph on
concept level
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Jobs seem to be 
\emph on
uniquely identified
\emph default
 by unit names.
 Thus it is not possible to 
\emph on
address
\emph default
 multiple different jobs belonging to the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 unit.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An example: 
\family typewriter
systemctl start unitA
\family default
 is currently running, taking a long time to execute.
 During this, another command 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop unitA
\family default
 is started 
\emph on
in parallel
\emph default
 (e.g.
 from another commandline shell).
 According to the documented default behaviour 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=replace
\family default
, the old job may be 
\emph on
interrupted
\emph default
 in favour of the new one.
 However, interruption of a job may be interpreted as a job failure, possibly
 leading to state 
\family typewriter
failed
\family default
.
 However, a failed unit can no longer be stopped, it seems to be treated
 like if it were 
\emph on
already stopped
\emph default
.
 It is possible to reset a failed unit via 
\family typewriter
systemctl reset-failed unitA
\family default
, but then I found that it is also treated as if it were already stopped,
 such that 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop unitA
\family default
 just reports 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

success
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without doing anything.
 This may lead to 
\emph on
serious
\emph default
 problems in a HA world.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An example: unitA was executing a script 
\family typewriter
scriptA.sh
\family default
 in oneshot mode.
 Unit failure typically meant that the script was killed by a signal.
 Even if 
\family typewriter
scriptA.sh
\family default
 had a signal handler doing proper application cleanup, and even if there
 were no final SIGKILL which eventually killed the running signal handler,
 the 
\emph on
application
\emph default
 may get 
\emph on
stuck
\emph default
 in some 
\series bold
undefined application state
\series default
.
 But afterwards, one is unable to queue a stop job for cleanup
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Possibly, a new directive 
\family typewriter
ExecCleanup=
\family default
 could help.
 However, this could mean that a new command variant 
\family typewriter
systemctl cleanup unitA
\family default
 would need to be introduced.
 This would complicate the user interface.
 Instead, the author would prefer Idempotence, because Idempotences allows
 to use 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop unitA
\family default
 for cleanup.
 This results in a much simpler end-user interface.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as explained before.
 Notice that queuing a start job in place of a cleanup job is no option
 in general, at least in a HA world.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

According to the docs, there exists no 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=append
\family default
 or similar option, which would just queue / delay 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 new job for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 unit, until all conflicting previous jobs are gone.
 Notice that this would be always mathematically possible (e.g.
 resulting in a strictly sequential job order).
 An implementation should be technically possible, but currently it seems
 not implemented in systemd according to the docs.
 This lack of full dependency awareness for entering new jobs causes numerous
 other problems, not only the previously described ones.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The documentation 
\family typewriter
man systemd
\family default
 explains a subtle difference.
 The conflicts causing 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=fail
\family default
 to fail seem to be different from general conflicts in unit dependencies.
 Although not precisely documented, the observed behaviour luckily appears
 to make HA more likely.
 There remains some uncertainity caused by the documented failure possibility.
 A new option called 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=append
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=wait
\family default
 could resolve this, for example by resulting in strict sequential operations
 in place of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unnecessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 failures.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which resulted in some behavioural improvements) the 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=fail
\family default
 option can be used for a self-programmed busy-wait submission loop, in
 order to 
\emph on
approach
\emph default
 (but not to 
\emph on
guarantee
\emph default
 in HA sense) disturbance-free addition of new systemctl jobs obeying all
 specified dependencies, and without causing side effects on already queued
 / running jobs.
 However, this trick did not always help in the presence of the above mount
 unit failure example, triggered by 
\emph on
transitive
\emph default
 dependencies.
 Another remaining problem is the exit code: there is no documented difference
 showing the 
\emph on
reason
\emph default
 of the failure.
 Was it a conflict with another queued job caused by 
\family typewriter
--job-mode=fail
\family default
, or did the unit 
\emph on
itself
\emph default
 fail?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Not only in the presence of multiple jobs for the same unit (possibly submitted
 in parallel to each other), query operations like 
\family typewriter
systemctl is-active unitA
\family default
 (or 
\family typewriter
is-failed
\family default
 etc) are prone to races.
 A potential future solution could be externally visible job IDs for identifying
 jobs.
 Similar concepts are for example used in printer job spoolers for decades.
 Of course, information about terminated jobs have to be kept for some time,
 or until some maximum job entries are exhausted.
 In addition, true asynchronous invocation via 
\family typewriter
--no-block
\family default
 and later polling the job ID would also become possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Systemd lacks an important property called Idempotence.
 Idempotence is a very common feature in big industry plants, where hundreds
 of human workers may act on controlling hundrets of facilities.
 Each alarm call may cause a different person to try to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a problem.
 Idempotence is a 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 in such an industry environment.
 Idempotence means that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are always working when possible at all, 
\series bold
regardless of the previous state
\series default
 of the 
\emph on
machinery
\emph default
 (
\emph on
not
\emph default
 of some 
\emph on
software
\emph default
 state).
 For operations stuff, there is no need to obey any previous state.
 When pressing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button, it means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ensure that the machine including all of of its sub-components will be running
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, regardless whether it was running before, or not, or only half-running,
 or only an arbitrary subset of sub-components was running before.
 So the button press does not declare an operation, it declares a 
\series bold
target state
\series default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is the task of the Idempotence controller software to ensure that the
 target state is being reached 
\emph on
somehow
\emph default
.
 This does not specify a particular way for reaching the target state.
 In general, there might be multiple ways.
 Very sophisticated controller software may even try multiple ways, until
 one of them succeeds in reaching the specified target state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A future Idempotence feature of systemd could be implemented as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the unit file, an option for declaration of the Idempotence property
 could be added.
 Backwards compatibility: the semantics of conventional non-idempotent units
 should not be changed unless idempotence is declared explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When Idempotence is declared, 
\family typewriter
systemctl start
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop
\family default
 will 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 execute a start/stop job somewhen later, obeying all dependencies.
 Optionally, this could also mean that in 
\emph on
worst case
\emph default
 all conflicting previous jobs might need to terminate first.
 More sophisticated variants might provide mechanisms for 
\series bold
controlled abortion
\series default
 of startup operations, provided that they usually do not lead to failure
 at all.
 Care must be taken that failures caused by aborts will not occur too frequently
 for HA.
 When failures caused by aborts are occuring too frequently, the concept
 of abort should be disabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When 
\family typewriter
ExecStart=
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ExecStop=
\family default
 is declared in an Idempotent unit, the script will be 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 executed, regardess of the previous internal systemd state of the unit.
 It is up to the script writer to ensure idempotence at his/her script code.
 This means, the 
\emph on
script
\emph default
 has to approach the application's target state independently from the previous
 application state, and has to report in its exit code whether the 
\emph on
target state
\emph default
 has been actually reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A very helpful addition to 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 systemd unit (not only to Idempotent ones) would be a new directive 
\family typewriter
ExecCheck=
\family default
 .
 In place of keeping a copy of the application state inside of systemd,
 it would allow to directly 
\series bold
poll
\series default
 the actual 
\emph on
application
\emph default
 state via callback, whenever it becomes necessary.
 The user could provide a state-checking script which has no side effects,
 other than querying the actual state of the application.
 This feature would be extremely helpful for turning 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 conventional unit into an idempotent one, likely without need for changing
 anything else (e.g.
 in third-party software, even when it lacks idempotence).
 Only when actual state checking is available and when it does not fail,
 Idempotent units may be allowed to skip the execution of other 
\family typewriter
ExecStartOrStop=
\family default
 actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ideal case, 
\family typewriter
ExecCheck=
\family default
 or another measure for achieving true HA idempotence might make the above
 
\family typewriter
*.script
\family default
 workaround superfluous.

 It also reduces the risk for parallel execution with some other units,
 but unfortunately cannot provide full mutual exclusion with everything
 else.
 Hopefully a future version of systemd will allow specification of full

mars.path
\family default
 This ensures that the mountpoint

 is already mounted before 
\family typewriter
mars.service
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
mars.service
\family default
 This starts and stops the MARS kernel module, provided that 
\family typewriter

 The latter can be ensured by classical 
\family typewriter
/etc/fstab
\family default
 methods, or by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
mars-trigger.path

leave-resource
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
set-systemd-unit

 Local triggering is also possible via

 When triggered, the command 
\family typewriter
marsadm systemd-trigger-extern
\family default
 (without

 It also ensures that the marsadm command is never called in parallel to

 Pitfall: systemd's path unit watchers are based on the 
\family typewriter
inotify
\family default
 infrastructure of the kernel.
 By default, many kernels are configured to a rather low number of inotify
 watches.
 When using more than 20 MARS resources, or when userspace also consumes
 inotify watches, some of the path watches may not start up (typical 
\family typewriter

\family default
 messages are hinting at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

resource
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Except for .script workarounds, 
\family typewriter
$start_unit
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
$stop_unit
\family default
 will typically denote 
\emph on
different
\emph default
 targets for start and stop (with few exceptions) for the following reason:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: assume your native systemd-controlled stack consists of 
\family typewriter
vol-@escvar{res}.mount
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
nfs-export-@escvar{res}.service
\family default
.
 Before the filesystem can be exported via 
\family typewriter
nfs
\family default
, it 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 needs to be mounted.
 At startup, 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 can do this automatically for you: just add a 
\family typewriter
Requires=
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BindsTo=
\family default
 dependency between both targets, or similar.
 Then, simply use 
\family typewriter
nfs-export-mydata.service
\family default
 as your start unit.
 Whenever it (thinks that it) needs to be started, systemd will automatically
 analyze its dependencies and automatically start 
\family typewriter
vol-mydata.mount
\family default
.
 However, stopping is different.
 Theoretically, 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop nfs-export-mydata.service
\family default
 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 work in some cases, but in general it doesn't work this way.
 Reason: there might be other 
\emph on
sister
\emph default
 units which 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 depend on the mount.
 In some cases, you may not necessarily notice any sisters, because systemd
 can add further (internal) targets 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
.
 The problem is easily solvable by using 
\family typewriter
BindsTo=
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
PartOf=
\family default
 dependencies, peferably augmented with 
\family typewriter
After=
\family default
, and then 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop vol-mydata.mount
\family default
 will automatically tear down 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 dependencies in reverse order.
 Therefore, use the 
\emph on
bottom
\emph default
 of the stack (usually a mount unit) as your stop unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For maximum safety, 
\family typewriter
$start_unit
\family default
 should always point at the 
\emph on
tip
\emph default
 of your stack, while 
\family typewriter
$stop_unit
\family default
 should always point at the 
\emph on
bottom
\emph default
 (but one level higher than 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/$res
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Removing any systemd targets is also possible via 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-systemd-unit $res

 Tip: groups of units can be controlled via .target units, see 
\family typewriter
man systemd.target
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
When everything is set up properly, the following should work:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Issue 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary $res
\family default
 on another node which is currently in secondary role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As a consequence, 
\family typewriter
systemctl stop 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

$stop_unit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 should be automatically executed at the old primary side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After a while, the MARS kernel module will notice that 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/$res
\family default
 is no longer opened.
 You can check this manually via
\family typewriter
 marsadm view-device-opened $res
\family default
 which will tell you a boolean result.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

 In case the device is not closed for any reason, ordinary handover 
\emph on
cannot
\emph default
 proceed, because somebody could (at least potentially) write some data
 into it, even after the handover, which would lead to a split brain.
 Therefore MARS 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 insist that the device is closed before 
\emph on
ordinary
\emph default
 handover can proceed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 9

\end_inset

 In order to not leave you with a failed service, umount failures will be
 detected after a timeout.
 Handover by marsadm will then 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 restart the old start unit at the old primary side where the the device
 was not released.

\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

 In case an ordinary handover is not possible due to hanging device openings,
 you have the following options:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Check your 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 configuration or other sources of error why the device is not closed.
 Possible reasons could be hanging processes or hanging sessions which might
 need a 
\family typewriter
kill
\family default
 or a 
\family typewriter
kill -9
\family default
 or similar.
 Notice that 
\family typewriter
lsof
\family default
 does not catch 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 possible sources like (recursive or bind-) mounts occupied by foreign kernel
 namespaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a failover via 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
, which will likely provoke a split brain.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Once 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/$res
\family default
 has disappeared, the ordinary MARS handover from the old primary to the
 new site should proceed as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/$res
\family default
 has appeared at the new site, 
\family typewriter
systemctl start 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

$start_unit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 should be executed automaticy.
 In turn, this should bring up your configured services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Details depend on your 
\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 configuration / templates.
 For example, you can configure systemd targets for activation of VMs, or
 for 
\family typewriter
LXC
\family default
 containers, or for 
\family typewriter
iSCSI
\family default
 exports, or for 
\family typewriter
nfs
\family default
 exports, or for 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 exports, or for whatever you need.
 For true geo-redundancy, you will likely have to include some 
\family typewriter
quagga
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
bird
\family default
 or other BGP configurations into your systemd unit stack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

 In general, marsadm tries to keep your services running whenever a handover
 failure occurs, or when you re-attach after a detach, or when your machine
 reloads 
\family typewriter
mars.ko
\family default
 after a crash reboot, etc.
 This is regarded as a 
\emph on
feature
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MatieresCorrosives.png
	lyxscale 50

\end_inset

 However, this feature could become boring if you 
\emph on
intentionally(!)
\emph default
 want to stop your services, for example when you need to run an 
\family typewriter
fsck
\family default
.
 Do not use 
\family typewriter
marsadm secondary
\family default
, because this would make 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 to disappear.
 Although 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-systemd-unit mydata 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 would solve the problem, this could make you forget the old start and stop
 unit names (if you don't use markers like DEFAULT etc).
 You could workaround by some wrapper script remembering the old names via
 
\family typewriter
marsadm get-systemd-unit
\family default
, but this is not necessary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 9
	scale 5

\end_inset

 There is a simple solution: 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-systemd-want 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(none)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 will 
\emph on
temporarily
\emph default
 stop the whole systemd unit stack, while keeping 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 accessible.
 After your 
\family typewriter
fsck /dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 has finished, simply use an idempotent 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary mydata
\family default
 for restart of your services.

\begin_layout Standard
The macro processor is a very flexible and versatile tool for

 Conceptually, two levels of macros are discriminated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
primitive macros: these are firmly built into

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Exceptions are possible when using

MARS can only guarantee local consistency, but cannot guarantee actuality

 Notice that a general notion of

actuality
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is 
\emph on
undefinable

 in a widely distributed system at all, according to Einstein's laws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let's look at an example.
 In case of a node crash, and after the node is up again, a 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 has to occur, in order to replay the transaction logs of MARS again.
 However, at the recovery phase before, the journalling 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 filesystem 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 have rolled back some internal symlink updates which have occurred immediately
 before the crash.
 MARS is relying on the fact that journalling filesystems like 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 should do their recovery in a consistent way, possibly by sacrifycing actuality
 a little bit.
 Therefore, the above macros cannot guarantee to deliver true information
 about what is persisted at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that there are further potential caveats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
{sync,fetch}-reached

\family typewriter
bio

 callbacks resp.
 
\family typewriter

\family default
 by default, thus the underlying storage layer has 
\emph on
told
\emph default
 us that it 
\emph on
believes
\emph default
 it has commited the data in a reboot-safe way.
 Whether this is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 true does not depend on MARS, but on the lower layers of the storage hierarchy.
 There exists hardware where this claim is known to be wrong under certain
 circumstances, such as certain hard disk drives in certain modes of operation.
 Please check the hardware for any violations of storage semantics under
 certain circumstances such as power loss, and check information sources
 like magazines about the problem area.
 Please notice that such a problem, if it exists at all, is independent
 from MARS.
 It would also exist if you wouldn't use MARS on the same system.

 macro scripts.
 It works via busy wait, and does not support disjoint waiting conditions.
 Use at your own risk! Hint: for disjoint and/or more complex waiting conditions
, and/or for programming your own finite state transition machines etc,
 please prefer the non-blocking 
\family typewriter
{is,todo}-*
\family default
 and sisters, and program any busy wait yourself (or try to avoid busy-wait
 at all).

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to create your own macros, you could start writing them from scratch
 with your favorite ASCII text editor.
 However, it is much easier to take an existing macro and to customize it
 to your needs.
 In addition, you can learn something about macro programming by looking
 at the existing macro code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to a new empty directory and say
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm dump-macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in order to get the most interesting complex macros, or say
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm dump-all-macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in order to additionally get some primitive macros which could be customized
 if needed.
 This will write lots of files 
\family typewriter
*.tpl
\family default
 into your current working directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any modfied or new macro file should be placed either into the current working
 directory 
\family typewriter
./
\family default
 , or into 
\family typewriter
$HOME/.marsadm/
\family default
 , or into 
\family typewriter
/etc/marsadm/
\family default
 .
 They will be searched in this order, and the first match will win.
 When no macro file is found, the built-in version will be used if it exists.
 This way, you may override builtin macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: if you have a file 
\family typewriter
./mymacro.tpl
\family default
 you just need to say 
\family typewriter
marsadm view-mymacro mydata
\family default
 in order to invoke it in the resource context 
\family typewriter
mydata
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General Macro Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macros are simple ASCII text, enriched with calls to other macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASCII text outside of comments are copied to the output verbatim.
 Comments are skipped.
 Comments may have one of the following well-known forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
# skipped text until / including next newline character
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
// skipped text until / including next newline character
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/* skipped text including any newline characters */
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
denoted as Perl regex: 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash

\backslash
n
\backslash
s* 
\family default
(single backslash directly followed by a newline character, and eating up
 any whitespace characters at the beginning of the next line) Hint: this
 may be fruitfully used to structure macros in a more readable form / indentatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special characters are always initiated by a backslash.
 The following pre-defined special character sequences are recognized:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 newline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\family default
 return (useful for DOS compatibility)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
t
\family default
 tab
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
f
\family default
 formfeed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
b
\family default
 backspace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
a
\family default
 alarm (bell)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
e
\family default
 escape (e.g.
 for generating ANSI escape sequences)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash

\family default
 followed by anything else: assure that the next character is taken verbatim.
 Although possible, please don't use this for escaping letters, because
 further escape sequences might be pre-defined in future.
 Best practice is to use this only for escaping the backslash itself, or
 for escaping the percent sign when you don't want to call a macro (protect
 against evaluation), or to escape a brace directly after a macro call (verbatim
 brace not to be interpreted as a macro parameter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All other characters stand for their own.
 If you like, you should be able to produce XML, HTML, JSON and other ASCII-base
d output formats this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macro calls have the following syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
arg1
\emph default
}{
\emph on
arg2
\emph default
}{
\emph on
argn
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, arguments may be empty, denoted as 
\family typewriter
{}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to supply more arguments than required.
 These are simply ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There must be always at least 1 argument, even for parameterless macros.
 In such a case, it is good style to leave it empty (even if it is actually
 ignored).
 Just write 
\family typewriter
%parameterlessmacro{}
\family default
 in such a case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%{
\emph on
varname
\emph default
}
\family default
 syntax: As a special case, the macro name may be empty, but then the first
 argument must denote a previously defined variable (such as assigned via
 
\family typewriter
%let{varname}{myvalue}
\family default
, or a pre-defined standard variable like 
\family typewriter
%{res}
\family default
 for the current resource name, see later paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Predefined-Variables"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, parameter calls may be (almost) arbitrarily nested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, the 
\emph on
correctness
\emph default
 of nesting of braces must be generally obeyed, as usual in any other macro
 processor language.
 General rule: for each opening brace, there must be exactly one closing
 brace somewhere afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These rules are hopefully simple and intuitive.
 There are currently no exceptions.
 In particular, there is no special infix operator syntax for arithmetic
 expressions, and therefore no operator precedence rules are necessary.
 You have to write nested arithmetic expressions always in the above prefix
 syntax, like 
\family typewriter
%*{7}{%+{2}{3}}
\family default
 (similar to non-inverse polish notation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 9
	scale 5

\end_inset

When deeply nesting macros and their braces, you may easily find yourself
 in a feeling like in the good old days of Lisp.
 Use the above backslash-newline syntax to indent your macros in a readable
 and structured way.
 Fortunately, modern text editors like (x)emacs or vim have modes for dealing
 with the correctness of nested braces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calling Builtin / Primitive Macros
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Primitive macros can be called in two alternate forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%primitive-
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
something
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
something
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the 
\family typewriter
%primitive-*{}
\family default
 form, you 
\emph on
explicitly disallow
\emph default
 interception of the call by a 
\family typewriter
*.tpl
\family default
 file.
 Otherwise, you may override the standard definition even of primitive macros
 by your own template files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/MatieresCorrosives.png
	lyxscale 50
	scale 17

\end_inset

 Notice that 
\family typewriter
%call{}
\family default
 conventions are used in such a case.
 The parameters are passed via 
\family typewriter
%{0}
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset


\family typewriter
%{n}
\family default
 variables (see description below).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are already described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Predefined-Trivial-Macros"

\end_inset

.
 When calling one of them, the call will simply expand to the corresponding
 value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: 
\family typewriter
%get-primary{}
\family default
 will expand to the hostname of the current designated primary node.

\family default
 (concatenation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph default
} 
\family default
Evaluates

 When the variable does not exist, the empty string is returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%{++}{
\emph on
varname
\emph default

\family default
or 
\family typewriter
%{
\emph on

\family default
 Has the obvious well-known side effect e.g.
 from C or Java.
 You may also use 
\family typewriter

\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
++
\family default

 This is for simplification of boring if-else-if chains.
 The classical if-syntax (as shown above) has the drawback that inner if-parts
 need to be nested into outer else-parts, so rather deep nestings may occur
 when you are programming longer chains.
 This is an alternate syntax for avoidance of deep nesting.
 When giving an odd number of arguments, the last argument is taken as final
 else-part.

\begin_layout Standard
Both the

asynchronous communication model
\series default
 of MARS including the Lamport clock, and the 
\series bold
state model
\series default
 (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-State-of"

\end_inset

) is something you 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 should have in mind when you want to do some scripting.
 Here is some advice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't access anything on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directly, except for debugging purposes.
 Use 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avoid running scripts in parallel, other than for inspection / monitoring
 purposes.
 When you give two 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands in parallel (whether on the same host, or on different hosts belonging
 to the same cluster), it is possible to produce a mess.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 has no internal locking.
 There is no cluster-wide locking at all, because if would cause trouble
 during long-distance network outages.
 Unfortunately, some systems like Pacemaker are violating this in many cases
 (depending on their configuration).
 Best is if you have a dedicated / more or less centralized 
\series bold
control machine
\series default
 which controls masses of your georedundant working servers.
 This reduces the risk of running interfering actions in parallel.
 Of course, you need backup machines for your control machines, and in different
 locations.
 Not obeying this advice can easily lead to problems such as complex races
 which are very difficult to solve in long-distance distributed systems,
 even in general (not limited to MARS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-cluster
\family default
 is your friend.
 Whenever your (near-)central script has to switch between different hosts
 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
B
\family default
 (of the same cluster), use it in the following way:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm action1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm wait-cluster; marsadm action2

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family default

\begin_inset Graphics

 Don't ignore this advice! Interference is almost 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
! As a rule of thumb, precede almost any action command with some appropriate
 waiting command!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

In case of network problems, some command may hang (forever), if you don't

 You can check consistency via

 Only when a local disk shows a lower-case letter

 Please fix these problems first before believing that your local disk is
 unusable.
 Even if it is really inconsistent (which is very unlikely, typically occurring

Typical non-overloaded servers allow you to invalidate about 3 to 5 (or
 
\emph on
sometimes(!)
\emph default
 even tens of) resources in parallel, but highly overloaded machines may
 require 
\family typewriter
marsadm pause-sync $some_resource
\family default
 for load reduction.
 When more resources are affected by SPLIT BRAIN, regularly check whether
 
\family typewriter
df /mars/
\family default
 shows enough space to wait some time until you need to invalidate more
 resources according to 
\family typewriter
du -s /mars/resource-* | sort -n
\family default
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: during the resolution process, some other resources might have gone
 into emergency mode concurrently.
 In addition, it is possible that some secondaries are stuck at particular
 resources while the corresponding primary has 
\emph on
not yet
\emph default
 entered emergency mode.
 Please repeat the steps in such a case, and look for any emergency modes
 at secondaries additionally.
 When necessary, extend your list of

affected

 resources and/or secondary hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: be patient.
 Deleting large bulks of logfile data may take a long time, at least on

 You should give the cleanup processes at least 5 minutes before concluding
 that

 followed by primary-side

\family default
 had no effect! When unsure, use

Now your backup datacenter should continue servicing your clients.
 The final reconstruction of the originally primary datacenter works as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the damaged primary datacenter, ensure that nowhere the MARS kernel module
 is running.
 In case of a power blackout, you shouldn't have executed an automatic 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 anywhere during reboot, so you should be already done when all your nodes
 are up again.
 In case some nodes had no reboot, execute 
\family typewriter
rmmod mars
\family default
 everywhere.
 If 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 refuses to run, you may need to umount the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device first.
 When nothing else helps, you may just mass reboot your hanging nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the failed side, do 
\family typewriter
rm -rf /mars/resource-$mydata/
\family default
 for all those resources which had been primary before the blackout.
 Do this 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 for those cases, otherwise you will need unnecessary 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
s or 
\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
s later (e.g.
 when half of your nodes were already running at the surving side).
 In order to avoid unnecessary traffic, please do this only as far as really
 necessary.
 Don't remove any other directories.
 In particular, 
\family typewriter
/mars/ips/
\family default
 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 remain intact.
 In case you accidentally deleted them, or you had to re-create 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 from scratch, try 
\family typewriter
rsync
\family default
 with the correct options.

 Caution! before doing this, check that the corresponding directory exists

Un-Fencing: restore your network firewall / routes and check that they work
 (

ping
\family default
 etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 everywhere.
 All missing directories and their missing symlinks should be automatically
 fetched from the backup datacenter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run 
\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource $res
\family default
, but only at those places where the directory was removed previously, while
 using the same disk devices as before.
 This will minimize actual traffic thanks to the fast full sync algorithm.

It is 
\series bold
crucial
\series default
 that the fencing step 
\series bold
must
\series default
 be executed 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 any 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
! This way, no split brain will be 
\emph on
visible
\emph default
 at the backup datacenter side, because there is simply no chance for transferri
ng different versions over the network.
 It is also crucial to remove any (potentially diverging) resource directories
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the 
\family typewriter
modprobe
\family default
! This way, the backup datacenter never runs into split brain.
 This saves you a lot of detail work for split brain resolution when you
 have to restore bulks of nodes in a short time.

In case the repair of a full datacenter should take so extremely long that
 some 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 partitions are about to run out of space at the surviving side, you may
 use the 
\family typewriter
leave-resource --host=failed-node
\family default
 trick described earlier, followed by 
\family typewriter
log-delete-all
\family default
.
 Best if you have prepared a fully automatic script long before the incident,
 which executes suchalike only as far as necessary in each individual case.

Even better: train such scenarios in advance, and prepare scripts for mass

When all your secondaries are all homogenously located in a standby datacenter,
 they will be almost idle all the time.
 This is a waste of computing resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since MARS is no substitute for a full-fledged backup system, and since
 backups may put high system load onto your active side, you may want to
 utilize your passive hardware resources in a better way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS supports this thanks to its ability to switch the 
\family typewriter
pause-replay
\family default
 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
 from 
\family typewriter
pause-fetch
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is simple: just use 
\family typewriter
pause-replay
\family default
 at your secondary site, but leave the replication of transaction logfiles
 intact by deliberately 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 saying 
\family typewriter
pause-fetch
\family default
.
 This way, your secondary replica (block device) will stay frozen for a
 limited time, without loosing your redundancy: since the transaction logs
 will continue to replicate in the meantime, you can start 
\family typewriter
resume-replay
\family default
 at any time, in particular when a primary-side incident should happen unexpecte
dly.
 The former secondary will just catch up by replaying the outstanding parts
 of the transaction logs in order to become recent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, some 
\emph on
details
\emph default
 have to be obeyed.
 In particular, the current version of MARS needs an additional 
\family typewriter
detach
\family default
 operation, in order to release exclusive access to the underlying disk
 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv/$res
\family default
.
 Future versions of MARS are planned to support this more directly, without
 need for an intermediate 
\family typewriter
detach
\family default
 operation.

Beware: 
\family typewriter
mount -o ro /dev/vg/$res
\family default
 can lead to 
\series bold
unnoticed write operations
\series default
 if you are not careful! Some journalling filesystems like 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 may replay their journals onto the disk, leading to 
\emph on
binary
\emph default
 differences and thus 
\series bold
destroying your consistency
\series default
 later when you re-enable 
\family typewriter
resume-replay
\family default
!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

Therefore, you may use small LVM snapshots (only in such cases).
 Typically, 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
 journal replay will require only a few megabytes.
 Therefore you typically don't need much temporary space for this.
 Here is a more detailed description of steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm pause-replay $res
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm detach $res
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
lvcreate --size 100m --snapshot --name ro-$res /dev/vg/$res
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
mount -o ro /dev/vg/ro-$res /mnt/tmp
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now draw your backup from 
\family typewriter
/mnt/tmp/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
umount /mnt/tmp
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
lvremove -f /dev/vg/ro-$res
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm up $res
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: during the backup, the transaction logs will accumulate on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
.
 In order to avoid overflow of 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 (c.f.
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Defending-Overflow"

\end_inset

), don't unnecessarily prolong the backup duration.
