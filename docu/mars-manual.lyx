 MARS
\family default
 Light is a block-level storage replication system for long distances /
 flaky networks under GPL.
 It runs as a Linux kernel module.
 The sysadmin interface is similar to DRBD

\end_layout

\end_inset

, but its internal engine is completely different from DRBD: it works with
 
\series bold
transaction logging
\series default
, similar to some database systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Therefore, MARS Light can provide stronger 
\series bold
consistency guarantees
\series default
.
 Even in case of network bottlenecks / problems / failures, the secondaries
 may become outdated (reflect an elder state), but never become inconsistent.
 In contrast to DRBD, MARS Light preserves the 
\series bold
order of write operations
\series default
 even when the network is flaky (
\series bold

\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The current version of MARS Light supports 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 replicas and works 
\series bold
asynchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, application performance is completely decoupled from any network
 problems.
 Future versions are planned to also support synchronous or near-synchronous
 modes.

Why You should Replicate Big Data at Block Layer
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people think that replication is easily done at filesystem layer.
 There exist lots of cluster filesystems and other filesystem-layer solutions
 which claim to be able to replicate your data, sometimes even over long
 distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trying to replicate several petabytes of data, or some billions of inodes,
 is however a much bigger challenge than many people can imagine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing the wrong layer for 
\series bold
mass data replication
\series default
 may get you into trouble.
 Here is an explaination why replication at the block layer is more easy
 and less error prone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The picture shows the main components of a standalone Unix / Linux system.
 In the late 1970s / early 1980s, a so-called 
\series bold
Buffer Cache
\series default
 had been introduced into the architecture of Unix.
 Today's Linux has refined the concept to various internal caches such as
 the Page Cache and the Dentry Cache.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these caches serve only one purpose: they are reducing the load onto
 the storage by exploitation of fast RAM.
 A well-tuned cache can yield high cache hit ratios, typically 99%.
 In some cases (as observed in practice) even more than 99.9%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now start distributing the system over long distances.
 There are two potential cut points A and B.
 Cutting at A means replication at filesystem level.
 B means replication at block level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When replicating at A, you will notice that the caches are 
\emph on
below
\emph default
 your cut point.
 Thus you will have to re-implement 
\series bold
distributed caches
\series default
, and you will have to 
\series bold
maintain cache coherence
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When replicating at B, the Linux caches are 
\emph on
above
\emph default
 your cut point.
 Thus you will receive much less traffic, typically already reduced by a
 factor of 100, or even more.
 This is much more easy to cope with.
 You will also profit from 
\series bold
journalling filesystems
\series default
 like 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
.
 In contrast, 
\emph on
truly distributed
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the POSIX semantics would be always guaranteed cluster-wide,
 and even in case of partial failures.
 In practice, some distributed filesystems like NFS don't even obey the
 POSIX standard 
\emph on
locally
\emph default
 on 1 standalone client.
 We know of projects which have 
\emph on
failed
\emph default
 right because of this.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 journalling is typically not available with distributed cluster filesystems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
potential
\emph default
 drawback of block layer replication is that you are typically limited to
 active-passive replication.
 An active-active operation is not impossible at block layer (see combinations
 of DRBD with 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
), but less common, and less safe to operate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This limitation isn't necessarily caused by the choice of layer.
 It is simply caused by the 
\series bold
laws of physics
\series default
: communication is always limited by the speed of light.
 A distributed filesystem is nothing else but a logically 
\series bold
distributed shared memory
\series default
 (DSM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some decades of research on DSM have shown that there exist applications
 / workloads where the DSM model is 
\emph on
inferior
\emph default
 to the direct communication paradigm.
 Even in short-distance / cluster scenarios.
 Long-distance DSM is extremely cumbersome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore: you simply shouldn't try to solve long-distance communication
 needs via communication over filesystems.
 Even simple producer-consumer scenarios (one-way communication) are less
 performant (e.g.
 when compared to plain TCP/IP) when it comes to distributed POSIX semantics.
 There is simply too much 
\series bold
synchronisation overhead at metadata level
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a need for mixed operations at different locations in parallel:
 just split your data set into disjoint filesystem instances (or database
 / VM instances, etc).
 All you need is careful thought about the 
\emph on
appropriate
\emph default
 
\emph on
granularity
\emph default
 of your data sets (such as well-chosen 
\emph on
sets
\emph default
 of user homedirectory subtrees, or database sets logically belonging together,
 etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replication at filesystem level is often at single-file granularity.
 If you have several millions or even billions of inodes, you may easily
 find yourself in a snakepit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion: active-passive operation over long distances (such as between
 continents) is even an advantage.
 It keeps you from trying bad / almost impossible things.

There exist some use cases where DRBD is clearly better than MARS.
 1&1 has a long history of experiences with DRBD where it works very fine,
 in particular coupling Linux devices rack-to-rack via crossover cables.
 DRBD is just 
\emph on
constructed
\emph default
 for that use case (RAID-1 over network).
 In such a scenario, DRBD is better than MARS because it uses up less disk
 space resources.
 In addition, newer DRBD versions can run over high-speed but short-distance
 interconnects like Infiniband (via the SDP protocol).
 Another use case for DRBD is active-active / dual-primary mode, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 is appearantly not constructed for long distances.
 1&1 has some experiences on a specific short distance cluster where the
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
DRBD
\family default
 combination scaled a little bit better than 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
, but worse than 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 (using 2 clients in both cases -- notice that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 showed extremely bad performance when trying to enable active-active 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 replication between 2 server instances, therefore we ended up using active-pass
ive DRBD replication below a single 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 server).
 Conclusion: 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 < sharding.
 We found that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD scalability was about 2 times better than
 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD, while 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 on top of 
\family typewriter
DRBD
\family default
 in active-active mode was somewhere inbetween.
 All cluster comparisons with an increasing workload over time (measured
 as number of customers which could be safely operated).
 Each system was replaced by the next one when the respective scalability
 was at its respective end, each time leading to operational problems.
 The ultimate solution was to replace all of these clustering concepts by
 the general concept of 
\series bold
sharding

Active-active won't work over long distances at all because of high network

 Probably, for replication of whole clusters over long distances DRBD and
 MARS could be stacked: using DRBD on top for MARS for active-active clustering
 of 
\family typewriter
gfs2

 distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there exist other use cases where DRBD did not work as
 expected, leading to incidents and other operational problems.
 We analyzed them for our specific use cases.
 The later author of MARS came to the conclusion that they could only be
 resolved by fundamental changes in the overall architecture of DRBD.
 The development of MARS started at the personal initiative of the author,
 first in form of a personal project during holidays, but later picked up
 by 1&1 as an official project.

In order to describe the most important problem we found when DRBD was used
 to couple whole datacenters (each encompassing thousands of servers) over
 metro distances, we strip down that complicated real-life scenario to a
 simplified laboratory scenario in order to demonstrate the effect with
 minimal means.

 In addition, the effect is also reproducible by an elder version of the

The simplified scenario is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DRBD is loaded with a low to medium, but constant rate of write operations
 for the sake of simplicity of the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The network has some throughput bottleneck, depicted as a red line.
 For the sake of simplicity, we just linearly decrease it over time, starting
 from full throughput, down to zero.
 The decrease is very slowly over time (some minutes, or even hours).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen in this scenario?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the actual DRBD write throughput is lower than the network bandwidth
 (left part of the horizontal blue line), DRBD works as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the maximum network throughput (red line) starts to fall short of the
 required application throughput (first blue dotted line), we get into trouble.
 By its very nature, DRBD works 
\series bold
synchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, it 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 transfer all your application writes through the bottleneck, but now it
 is impossible
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is independent from the DRBD protocols A through C, because it just
 depends on an information-theoretic argument independently from any protocol.
 We have a fundamental conflict between network capabilities and application
 demands here, which cannot be circumvented due to the 
\series bold
synchronous
\series default
 nature of DRBD.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 due to the bottleneck.
 As a consequence, the application running on top of DRBD will see increasingly
 higher IO latencies and/or stalls / hangs.
 We found practical cases (at least with former versions of DRBD) where
 IO latencies exceeded practical monitoring limits such as 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 s by far, up to the range of 
\emph on
minutes
\emph default
.
 As an experienced sysadmin, you know what happens next: your application
 will run into an incident, and your customers will be dissatisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deal with such situations, DRBD has lots of tuning parameters.
 In particular, the 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 parameter and/or the 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 parameter will determine when DRBD will give up in such a situation and
 simply drop the network connection as an emergency measure.
 Dropping the network connection is roughly equivalent to an automatic 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, followed by an automatic re-connect attempt after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds.
 During the dropped connection, the incident will appear as being resolved,
 but at some hidden cost
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By appropriately tuning various DRBD parameters, such as 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
, you can keep the impact of the incident below some viable limit.
 However, the automatic disconnect will then happen earlier and more often
 in practice.
 Flaky or overloaded networks may easily lead to an enormous number of automatic
 disconnects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens next in our scenario? During the 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, DRBD will record all positions of writes in its bitmap and/or in its activity
 log.
 As soon as the automatic re-connect succeeds after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds, DRBD has to do a partial re-sync of those blocks which were marked
 dirty in the meantime.
 This leads to an 
\emph on
additional
\emph default
 bandwidth demand
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DRBD parameters 
\family typewriter
sync-rate
\family default
 resp 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
 may be used to tune the height of the additional demand.
 In addition, the newer parameters 
\family typewriter
c-plan-ahead
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-fill-target
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-delay-target
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-min-rate
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-max-rate
\family default
 and friends may be used to dynamically adapt to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 situations where the application throughput 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 fit through the bottleneck.
 These newer parameters were developed in a cooperation between 1&1 and
 Linbit, the maker of DRBD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Please note that lowering / dynamically adapting the resync rates may help
 in lowering the 
\emph on
probability
\emph default
 of occurrences of the above problems in practical scenarios where the bottlenec
k would recover to viable limits after some time.
 However, lowering the rates will also increase the 
\emph on
duration
\emph default
 of re-sync operations accordingly.
 The 
\emph on
total amount of re-sync data
\emph default
 simply does not decrease when lowering 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
; it even tends to increase over time when new requests arrive.
 Therefore, the 
\emph on
expectancy value
\emph default
 of problems caused by 
\emph on
strong
\emph default
 network bottlenecks (i.e.
 when not even the ordinary application rate is fitting through) is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 improved by lowering or adapting 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
, but rather the expectancy value mostly depends on the 
\emph on
relation
\emph default
 between the amount of holdback data versus the amount of application write

 BOW increases IO latencies during ordinary operation.
 Retaining snapshots is cheap, but reverting them may be very costly, depending

 We didn't fully investigate that effect, and our experience is a few years

 Here is one point in favour of DRBD: MARS stores its transaction logs on
 the filesystem 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
.
 When the network bottleneck is lasting very long (some days or even some
 weeks), the filesystem will eventually run out of space some day.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Defending-Overflow"

\end_inset

 discusses countermeasures against that in detail.
 In contrast to MARS, DRBD allocates its bitmap 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at resource creation time.
 It uses up less space, and you don't have to monitor it for (potential)
 overflows.
 The space for transaction logs is the price you have to pay if you want
 or need anytime consistency, or asynchronous replication in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to really grasp the 
\emph on
heart
\emph default
 of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication, we
 look at the following modified scenario:

This time, the network throughput (red line) is varying

In real life, many long-distance lines or even some heavily used metro lines
 usually show fluctuations of their network bandwidth by an order of magnitude,

 in some unpredictable way.
 As before, the application throughput served by MARS is assumed to be constant
 (dotted green line, often superseded by the solid green line).
 The actual replication network throughput is depicted by the solid green
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, a network dropdown undershooting the application demand
 has no impact on the application throughput, but only on the replication
 network throughput.
 Whenever the network throughput is held back due to the flaky network,
 it simply catches up as soon as possible by overshooting the application
 throughput.
 The amount of lag-behind is visualized as shaded area: downward shading
 (below the application throughput) means an increase of the lag-behind,
 while the upwards shaded areas (beyond the application throughput) indicate
 a decrease of the lag-behind (catch-up).
 Once the lag-behind has been fully caught up, the network throughput suddenly
 jumps back to the application throughput (here visible in two cases).
\end_layout

 DRBD disconnect states, and in turn to DRBD inconsistent states of the
 secondary as long as the lag-behind has not been fully cought up.

Of course, this visualization is not exact.
 On one hand, the DRBD inconsistency phase may start later as depicted here,
 because it only starts 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the first automatic disconnect, upon the first automatic re-connect.
 In addition, the amount of resync data may be smaller than the amount of
 corresponding MARS transaction logfile data, because the DRBD bitmap will
 coalesce multiple writes to the same block into one single transfer.
 On the other hand, DRBD will transfer no data at all during its disconnected
 state, while MARS continues its best.
 This leads to a prolongation of the DRBD inconsistent phase.
 Depending on properties of the workload and of the network, the real duration
 of the inconsistency phase may be both shorter or longer.
\end_layout

 duration of the corresponding DRBD inconsistency phase is visualized as

MARS utilizes the existing network bandwidth as best as possible in order
 to pipe through as much data as possible, provided that there exists some
 data requiring expedition.
 Conceptually, there exists no better way due to information theoretic limits
 (besides data compression).

In case of lag-behind, the version of the data replicated to the secondary
 site corresponds to some time in the past.
 Since the data is always transferred in the same order as originally submitted
 at the primary site, the secondary never gets inconsistent.
 Your mirror always remains usable.
 Your only potential problem could be the outdated state, corresponding
 to some state in the past.
 However, the

Conclusion: you can even use

 on MARS' TCP connections in order to globally balance your network throughput
 (of course at the cost of actuality, but without sacrificing local data
 consistency).
 If you would try to do the same with DRBD, you could easily provoke a disaster.
 MARS simply tolerates any network problems, provided that there is enough
 disk space for transaction logfiles.
 Even in case of completely filling up your disk with transaction logfiles
 after some days or weeks, you will not lose local consistency anywhere
 (see section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This time, the network throughput limit (solid red line) is assumed to be
 constant.
 However, the application workload (dotted green line) shows some heavy
 peaks.
 We know from our 1&1 datacenters that such an application behaviour is
 very common (e.g.
 in case of certain kinds of DDOS attacks etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the peaks are exceeding the network capabilities for some time, the
 replication network throughput (solid green line) will be limited for a
 short time, stay a little bit longer at the limit, and finally drop down
 again to the normal workload.
 In other words, you get a flexible buffering behaviour, coping with the
 peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar scenarios (where both the application workload has peaks and the
 network is flaky to some degree) are rather common.
 If you would use DRBD there, you were likely to run into regular application
 performance problems and/or frequent automatic disconnect cycles, depending
 on the height and on the duration of the peaks, and on network resources.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low latency combined with low throughput is also possible: in an ATM system

 factor on low-capacity but short lines, which is only possible at the cost
 of assigned bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the

 to worse throughput, because of the

\begin_layout Standard
We have experimented with extremely large TCP send/receive buffers plus

 But magic does not happen.
 Natural laws will always hold.
 You simply cannot travel faster than the speed of light.

There may be some exceptions, at least when dealing with low-end workstation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people, often located at database operations, are obtrusively arguing

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone arguing this way has at least the following choices (list may be
 incomplete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
None of the above use cases for MARS apply.
 For instance, short distance replication over crossover cables is sufficient
 (which occurs very often), or the network is reliable enough such that
 bottlenecks can never occur (e.g.
 because the total load is extremely low, or conversely the network is extremely
 overengineered / expensive), or the occurrence of bottlenecks can 
\emph on

 be taken into account.
 In such cases, DRBD is clearly the better solution than MARS, because it
 provides better actuality than the current version of MARS, and it uses
 up less disk resources.

In the presence of network bottlenecks, people didn't notice and/or didn't

 MARS assumes that it is running in a

Currently, MARS provides no shared secret like DRBD, because a simple shared

 Since you are an experienced sysadmin, you knew that, and it was just the

 If you didn't check that your old contents didn't contain any valuable

 The

 MARS (as well as DRBD) is completely ignorant of the

 Heavy-weight data is only transferred over the long-distance network upon

 This is extremely fast if your data is already (almost) identical on both

 Conversely, if you know in advance that your initial data is completely

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter

\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline

This starts appending to a new logfile on all of your resources.
 The logfiles are automatically numbered by an increasing 9-digit logfile
 number.
 This will suffice for many centuries even if you would logrotate once a

 Practical frequencies for logfile rotation are more like once an hour,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter

 In particular, the command

 Since MARS is operating asynchronously (in contrast to DRBD), it may take

\begin_layout Paragraph
Some Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to DRBD, split brain situations are handled differently by MARS
 Light.
 When two primaries are accidentally active at the same time, each of them
 writes into different logfiles 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-B
\family default
 where the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 host is always recorded in the filename.
 Therefore, both nodes 
\emph on
can theoretically
\emph default
 run in primary mode independently from each other, at least for some time.
 They 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 even 
\family typewriter
log-rotate
\family default
 independently from each other.
 However, this is really no good idea.
 The replication to third nodes will likely get stuck, and your 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem(s) will eventually run out of space.
 Any further secondary node (when having 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 replicas) will certainly get into serious problems: it simply does not
 know which split-brain version it should follow.
 Therefore, you will certainly loose the actuality of your redundancy.

\family typewriter
marsadm secondary

 It tells the whole cluster that

\emph on
All

 nodes should go into secondary mode, globally.
 In the current version of MARS Light, the secondaries will no long fetch
 any logfiles, since they don't know which version is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one.
 Syncing is also not possible.
 When the device 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is in use somewhere, it will remain in 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 primary mode during that time.
 As soon as the local 
\family typewriter

\emph on

 You should avoid it in advance by always

 Split brain situations are detected 
\emph on
passively
\emph default
 by secondaries.
 Whenever a secondary detects that somewhere a split brain has happend,
 it refuses to replay any logfiles behind the split point (and also to fetch
 them when possible), or anywhere where something appears suspect or ambiguous.
 This tries to keep its local disk state always being consistent, but outdated
 with respect to any of the split brain versions.
 As a consequence, becoming primary may be impossible, because it cannot
 always know which logfiles are the correct ones to replay before 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 can appear.
 The ambiguity must be resolved first.

Probably it could be possible to formally model MARS as a Petri net.

 Expressing hierarchy, in a top-down fashion, is cumbersome.
 We find no clue in trying to do so.

 the synchronous control behaviour of DRBD at the interface level (
\family typewriter

 As an experiencend sysadmin, you will be curious how it works in principle.
 When you know something about it, you will no longer be surprised when
 some (detail) behaviour is different from DRBD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general principle is an asynchronous 2-edge handshake protocol, which
 is used almost everywhere in MARS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a binary todo switch, which can be either in state 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In addition, we have an actual response indicator, which is similar to
 an LED indicating the actual status.
 In our example, we imagine that both are used for controlling a big ventilator,
 having a huge inert mass.
 Imagine a big machine from a power plant, which is as tall as a human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start in a situation where the binary switch is off, and the ventilator
 is stopped.
 At point 1, we turn on the switch.
 At that moment, a big contactor will sound like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zonggg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and a big motor will start to hum.
 At first you won't hear anything else.
 It will take a while, say 1 minute, until the big wheel will have reached
 its final operating RPM, due to the huge inert mass.
 During that spin-up, the lights in your room will become slightly darker.
 When having reached the full RPM at point 2, your workplace will then be
 noisier, but in exchange your room lights will be back at ordinary strength,
 and the actual response LED will start to lit in order to indicate that
 the big fan is now operational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume we want to turn the system off.
 When turning the todo switch to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at point 3, first nothing will seem to happen at all.
 The big wheel will keep spinning due to its heavy inert mass, and the RPM
 as well as the sound will go down only slowly.
 During spin-down, the actual response LED will stay illuminated, in order
 to warn you that you should not touch the wheel, otherwise you may get
 injuried
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that it is only safe to access the wheel when 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 the switch and the LED are off.
 Conversely, if at least one of them is on, something is going on inside
 the machine.
 Transferred to MARS: always look at 
\emph on
both

 the todo switch and the correponding actual indicator in order to not miss
 something.
\end_layout

 The LED will only go off after, say, 2 minutes, when the wheel has actually
 stopped at point 4.
 After that, the cycle may potentially start over again.

As you can see, all four possible cartesian product combinations between
 two boolean values are occurring in the diagram.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The picture shows the flow of write requests.
 Let's start with the primary node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon submission of a write request on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
, it is first buffered in a 
\emph on
temporary
\emph default
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temporary memory buffer serves multiple purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It keeps track of the order of write operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, it keeps track of the positions in the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
.
 In particular, it detects when the same block is overwritten multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
During pending write operation, any concurrent reads are served from the
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the write has been buffered in the temporary memory buffer, the main
 logger thread of the transaction logger creates a so-called 
\emph on
log entry
\emph default
 and starts an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

append
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation on the transaction logfile.
 The log entry contains vital information such as the logical block number
 in the underlying disk, the length of the data, a timestamp, some header
 magic in order to detect corruption, the log entry sequence number, of
 course the data itself, and optional information like a checksum or compression
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the log entry has been written through to the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem via fsync(), the application waiting for the write operation
 at 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is signalled that the write was successful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may happen even 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the writeback to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
 has started.
 Even when you power off the system right now, the information is not lost:
 it is present in the logfile, and can be reconstructed from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the order of log records present in the transaction log defines
 a total order among the write requests which is 
\emph on
compatible
\emph default
 to the partial order of write requests issued on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that despite its sequential nature, the transaction logfile
 is typically 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the performance bottleneck of the system: since appending to a logfile
 is almost purely sequential IO, it runs much faster than random IO on typical
 datacenter workloads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reclaim the temporary memory buffer, its content must be written
 back to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydat
\family default
a somewhen.
 After writeback, the temporary space is freed.
 The writeback can do the following optimizations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
writeback may be in 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 order; in particular, it may be 
\emph on
sorted
\emph default
 according to ascending sector ´numbers.
 This will reduce the average seek distances of magnetic disks in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
when the same sector is overwritten multiple times, only the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version need to be written back, skipping some intermediate versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the primary node crashes during writeback, it suffices to replay
 the log entries from some point in the past until the end of the transaction
 logfile.
 It does no harm if you accidentally replay some log entries twice or even
 more often: since the replay is in the original total order, any temporary
 inconsistency is 
\emph on
healed
\emph default
 by the logfile application.

 Example: the asynchronous communication protocol of MARS leads to a different
 behaviour from DRBD in case of 
\series bold
network partitions
\series default
 (temporary interruption of communication between some cluster nodes), because
 MARS 
\emph on
remembers
\emph default
 the old state of remote nodes over long periods of time, while DRBD knows
 absolutely nothing about its peers in disconnected state.
 Sysadmins familiar with DRBD might find the following behaviour unusual:

 clock.
 MARS uses a special variant called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical Lamport clock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock is another almost-realtime clock which 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 run independently from the Linux kernel system clock.
 However, the Lamport clock tries to remain as near as possible to the system
 clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both clocks can be queried at any time via 
\family typewriter
cat /proc/sys/mars/lamport_clock
\family default
.
 The result will show both clocks in parallel, in units of seconds since
 the Unix epoch, with nanosecond resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are no network messages at all, both the system clock and the
 Lamport clock will show almost the same time (except some minor differences
 of a few nanoseconds resulting from the finite processor clock speed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock works rather simple: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 message on the network is augmented with a Lamport time stamp telling when
 the message was 
\emph on
sent
\emph default
 according to the local Lamport clock of the sender.
 Whenever that message is received by some receiver, it checks whether the
 time ordering relation would be violated: whenever the Lamport timestamp
 in the message would claim that the sender had sent it 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 it arrived at the receiver (according to drifts in their respective local
 clocks), something must be wrong.
 In this case, the local Lamport clock of the 
\emph on
receiver
\emph default
 is advanced shortly after the sender Lamport timestamp, such that the time
 ordering relation is no longer violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, any local Lamport clock may precede the corresponding
 local system clock.
 In order to avoid accumulation of deltas between the Lamport and the system
 clock, the Lamport clock will run slower after that, possibly until it
 reaches the system clock again (if no other message arrives which sets
 it forward again).
 After having reached the system clock, the Lamport clock will continue
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS uses the local Lamport clock for anything where other systems would
 use the local system clock: for example, timestamp generation in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
 Even symlinks created there are timestamped according to the Lamport clock.
 Both the kernel module and the userspace tool 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 are always operating in the timescale of the Lamport clock.
 Most importantly, all timestamp comparisons are always carried out with
 respect to Lamport time.

 Bigger differences between the Lamport and the system clock can be annoying

\family typewriter

\family default
 many timestamps may appear as if they were created in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the 
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 command compares the output formatting against the system clock (it does
 not even know of the existence of the MARS Lamport clock).

 Always use 
\family typewriter
ntp

 (or another clock synchronization service) in order to pre-synchronize
 your system clocks as close as possible.
 Bigger differences are not only annoying, but may lead some people to wrong
 conclusions and therefore even lead to bad human decisions!

 A fundamentally different behaviour than DRBD: when your DRBD primary crashed
 some time ago, and now comes up again, you have to setup DRBD again by
 a sequence of commands like 
\family typewriter
modprobe drbd; drbdadm up all; drbdadm primary all
\family default
 or similar.
 In contrast, MARS needs only 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 (after 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 has been mounted by 
\family typewriter
/etc/fstab
\family default
).
 The 
\emph on
persistence
\emph default
 of the symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 will automatically remember your previous state, even if some your resources
 were primary while others were secondary (mixed operations).
 You don't need to do any actions in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a previous state, no matter how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Almost) all symlinks appearing in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory tree are automatically replicated thoughout the whole cluster,
 provided that the cluster 
\family typewriter
uuid
\family default
s are equal
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is protection against accidental 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

merging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of two unrelated clusters which had been created at different times with
 different 
\family typewriter
uuids
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 at all sites.
 Thus the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory forms some kind of 
\emph on
global namespace
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid name clashes, each pathname created at node A follows
 a convention: the node name A should be a suffix of the pathname.
 Typically, internal MARS names follow the scheme 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\emph on
something
\emph default
/myname-A
\family default
.
 When using the expert command 
\family typewriter
marsadm {get,set}-link
\family default
 (which will likely be replaced by something else in future MARS releases),
 you should follow the best practice of systematically using pathnames like
 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-A
\family default
 or similar.
 As a result, each node will automatically get informed about the state
 at any other node, like B when the corresponding information is recorded
 on node B under the name 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-B
\family default
 (context-dependent names).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12

\end_inset

 Experts only: the symlink replication works generically.
 You might use the 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/
\family default
 directory in order to place your own symlink there (for whatever purpose,
 which need not have to do with MARS).
 However, the symlinks are likely to disappear.
 Use 
\family typewriter
marsadm {get,set}-link
\family default
 instead.
 There is a chance that these abstract commands (or variants thereof) will
 be retained, by acting on the new data representation in future, even if
 the old symlink format will vanish some day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

Important: the convention of placing the 
\series bold
creator host name
\series default
 inside your pathnames should be used wherever possible.
 The name part is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ownership indicator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is crucial that no other host writes any symlink not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

belonging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to him.
 Other hosts may read foreign information as often as they want, but never
 modify them.
 This way, your cluster nodes are able to 
\emph on
communicate
\emph default
 with each other via symlink / information updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although experts might create (and change) the current symlinks with userspace
 tools like 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
, you should use the following marsadm commands instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm set-link myvalue /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons for this: first, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link
\family default
 command will automatically use the Lamport clock for symlink creation,
 and therefore will avoid any errors resulting from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system clock (as in 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
).
 Second, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file
\family default
 (which also deletes symlinks) works on the 
\emph on
whole cluster
\emph default
.
 And finally, there is a chance that this will work in future versions of
 MARS even after the symlinks have vanished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the difference? If you would try to remove your symlink locally by
 hand via 
\family typewriter
rm -f
\family default
, you will be surprised: since the symlink has been replicated to the other
 cluster nodes, it will be re-transferred from there and will be resurrected
 locally after some short time.
 This way, you cannot delete any object reliably, because your whole cluster
 (which may consist of many nodes) remembers all your state information
 and will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it whenever 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

In order to solve the deletion problem, MARS Light uses some internal deletion
 protocol using auxiliary symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/.

\family default
 The deletion protocol ensures that all replicas get deleted in the whole
 cluster, and only thereafter the auxiliary symlinks in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/
\family default
 are also deleted eventually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may update your already existing symlink via 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link some-other-value /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\family default
 .
 The new value will be propagated throughout the cluster according to a
 
\series bold
timestamp comparison protocol
\series default
: whenever node B notices that A has a 
\emph on
newer
\emph default
 version of some symlink (according to the Lamport timestamp), it will replace
 its elder version by the newer one.
 The opposite does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 work: if B notices that A has an elder version, just nothing happens.
 This way, the timestamps of symlinks can only progress in forward direction,
 but never backwards in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, symlink updates made 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 via 
\family typewriter
ln -sf
\family default
 may get lost when the local system clock is much more earlier than the
 Lamport clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your cluster is fully connected by the network, the last timestamp
 will finally win everywhere.
 Only in case of network outages leading to 
\emph on
network partitions
\emph default
, some information may be 
\emph on
temporarily inconsistent
\emph default
, but only for the duration of the network outage.
 The timestamp comparison protocol in combination with the Lamport clock
 and with the persistence of the

/mars/
\family default
 filesystem will automatically heal any temporary inconsistencies as soon
 as possible, even in case of temporary node shutdown.

\begin_layout Standard
The meaning of some internal MARS Light symlinks residing in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes an important difference to DRBD.
 The metadata of DRBD is allocated 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
creation
\emph default
 
\emph on
time
\emph default
 of the resource.
 In contrast, the MARS transaction logfiles are allocated 
\emph on
dynamically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
runtime
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to a potential risk from the perspective of a sysadmin: what
 happens if the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem runs out of space?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No risk, no fun.
 If you want a system which survives long-lasting network outages while
 keeping your replicas always consistent (anytime consistency), you 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 dynamic memory for that.
 It is 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to solve that problem using static memory
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bitmaps used by DRBD don't preserve the 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 of write operations.
 They cannot do that, because their space is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(k)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, MARS preserves the order.
 Preserving the order as such (even when only 
\emph on
facts
\emph default
 about the order were recorded without recording the actual data contents)
 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 space where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is infinitely growing over time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, DRBD and MARS have different application areas.
 If you just want a simple system for mirroring your data over short distances
 like a crossover cable, DRBD will be a suitable choice.
 However, if you need to replicate over longer distances, or if you need
 higher levels of reliability even when multiple failures may accumulate
 (such as network loss during a 
\emph on
re
\emph default
sync of DRBD), the transaction logs of MARS can solve that, but at some
 
\emph on
cost

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motivation: in rare cases, some users with

ssh
\family default
 access can do 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 silly things.
 For example, some of them are creating their own backups via user-cron
 jobs, and they do it every 5 minutes.
 Some example guy created a zip archive (almost 1GB) by regularly copying
 his old zip archive into a new one, then appending deltas to the new one,
 and finally deleting the old archive.
 Every 5 minutes.
 Yes, every 5 minutes, although almost never any new files were added to
 the archive.
 Essentially, he copied over his archive, for nothing.
 This led to massive bulk write requests, for ridiculous reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, your hard disks (or even RAID systems) allow much higher write
 IO rates than you can ever transport over a standard TCP network from your
 primary site to your secondary, at least over longer distances (see use
 cases for MARS in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Use-Cases-for"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it is easy to create a such a high write load that it will be
 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to replicate it over the network, 
\emph on
by construction
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we

need

 some mechanism for throttling bulk writers whenever the network is weaker

 Typical values for this are 60%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_end_percent

 Maximum throttling will occur once this space threshold is reached, i.e.
 the throttling is now at its maximum effect.
 Typical values for this are 90%.

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
When

 there is only one exit strategy: stop creating new logfile data.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
When entering emergency mode, the kernel module will execute the following
 steps for all resources where the affected host is acting as a primary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logfile is left empty, i.e.
 no data ist written to it (for now).
 The hole in the numbering will prevent any secondaries from replaying any
 logfiles behind the hole (should they ever contain some data, e.g.
 because the emergency mode has been left again).
 This works because the secondaries are regularly checking the logfile numbers
 for contiguity, and they will refuse to replay anything which is not contiguous.
 As a result, the secondaries will be left in a consistent, but outdated
 state (at least if they already were consistent before that).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kernel module writes back all data present in the temporary memory buffer
 (see figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Transaction-Logger"

).
 This may lead to a (short) delay of user write requests until that has
 finished (typically fractions of a second or a few seconds).
 The reason is that the temporary memory buffer must not be increased in
 parallel during this phase (race conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the temporary memory buffer is empty, all local IO requests (whether
 reads or writes) are directly going to the underlying disk.
 This has the same effect as if MARS would not be present anymore.
 Transaction logging does no longer take place.

\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 comes with a customizable macro processor.
 It can be used for high-level complex display of the state of MARS (so-called
 
\emph on
complex macros
\emph default
), as well as for low-level display of lots of individual state values (so-calle
d 
\emph on
primitive macros

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the commandline, any macro can be called via 
\family typewriter
marsadm view-

$macroname
\emph default
 mydata

 The short form

-global
\family default
 will be called with an empty 
\family typewriter

 argument, provided that such a macro is defined.
 This way, you can produce per-resource output followed by global output
 which does not depend on a particular resource.

 checksum error in a transaction logfile, or another (hardware / filesystem)

 This occurs extremely rarely in practice, but has been observed more frequently

 Notice that a secondary

 Although this message is

 for the diskstate.
 A damaged transaction logfile will always affect the

 of the disk, but not its

integrity
\emph default
 (by itself).
 What to do in such a case?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
When the damage is only at one of your secondaries, you should first ensure
 that the primary has a good logfile after a 
\family typewriter

\family default

\family typewriter
marsadm invalidate
\family default
 at the damaged secondary.
 It is crucial that the primary has a fresh correct logfile behind the error
 position, and that it is continuing to operate correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of your secondaries are reporting 
\family typewriter
DefectiveLog
\family default
, the primary could have 
\emph on
produced
\emph default
 a damaged logfile (e.g.
 in RAM, in a DMA channel, etc) while continuing to operate, and all of
 your secondaries got that defective logfile.
 After 
\family typewriter
marsadm log-delete-all all
\family default
, you can check this by comparing the 
\family typewriter
md5sum
\family default
 of the first primary logfile (having the lowest serial number) with the
 versions on your replicas.
 The problem is that you don't know whether the primary side has a silent
 corruption on any of its disks, or not.
 You will need to take an operational decision whether to switchover to
 a secondary via 
\family typewriter
primary --force
\family default
, or whether to continue operation at the primary and 
\family typewriter
invalidate
\family default
 your secondaries.

 Thus

 due to this error (which typically occurs extremely rarely, observed two

switchover to a former secondary via

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that the

 Therefore, the underlying disk is only guaranteed to be consistent when
 there is no data left to be written back.
 Notice that this condition is racy by construction.
 When your primary node crashes during writeback and then comes up again,
 you must do a 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 first in order to automatically replay the transaction logfiles, which
 will automatically heal such temporary inconsistencies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Don't confuse this with the consistency of

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Exceptions are possible when using 
\family typewriter
marsadm fake-sync
\family default
.
 Even in split brain situations, 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary --force
\family default
 tries to prevent any further potential exception as best as it can, by
 not letting 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 to appear and by insisting on split brain resolution first.
 In future implementations, this might change if more pressure is put on
 the developer to sacrifice consistency in preference to not waiting for
 a full logfile replay.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 By construction of MARS, the disk of secondaries will 
\emph on

Recall from chapter

 that MARS Light (in its current stage of development) does only guarantee

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let's look at an example.
 In case of a node crash, and after the node is up again, a

 has to occur, in order to replay the transaction logs of MARS again.
 However, at the recovery phase before, the journalling

may
\emph default
 have rolled back some internal symlink updates which have occurred immediately

 MARS is relying on the fact that journalling filesystems like 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 should do their recovery in a consistent way, possibly by sacrifycing actuality
 a little bit.
 Therefore, the above macros cannot guarantee to deliver true information

 by default, thus the underlying storage layer has 
\emph on
told
\emph default
 us that it

 it has commited the data in a reboot-safe way.
 Whether this is

really

 true does not depend on MARS, but on the lower layers of the storage hierarchy.
 There exists hardware where this claim is known to be wrong under certain
 circumstances, such as certain hard disk drives in certain modes of operation.
 Please check the hardware for any violations of storage semantics under
 certain circumstances such as power loss, and check information sources
 like magazines about the problem area.
 Please notice that such a problem, if it exists at all, is independent

In order to create your own macros, you could start writing them from scratch

 In addition, you can learn something about macro programming by looking
 at the existing macro code.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 This will write lots of files

\family typewriter
$HOME/.marsadm/
\family default
 , or into 
\family typewriter
/etc/marsadm/
\family default

 They will be searched in this order, and the first match will win.
 When no macro file is found, the built-in version will be used if it exists.
 This way, you may override builtin macros.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macros are simple ASCII text, enriched with calls to other macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASCII text outside of comments are copied to the output verbatim.
 Comments are skipped.
 Comments may have one of the following well-known forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
# skipped text until / including next newline character
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
// skipped text until / including next newline character

denoted as Perl regex: 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash

\backslash
n
\backslash
s* 
\family default
(single backslash directly followed by a newline character, and eating up
 any whitespace characters at the beginning of the next line) Hint: this
 may be fruitfully used to structure macros in a more readable form / indentatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special characters are always initiated by a backslash.
 The following pre-defined special character sequences are recognized:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 newline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\family default
 return (useful for DOS compatibility)

\begin_layout Itemize

\family default
 escape (e.g.
 for generating ANSI escape sequences)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash

\family default
 followed by anything else: assure that the next character is taken verbatim.
 Although possible, please don't use this for escaping letters, because
 further escape sequences might be pre-defined in future.
 Best practice is to use this only for escaping the backslash itself, or
 for escaping the percent sign when you don't want to call a macro (protect
 against evaluation), or to escape a brace directly after a macro call (verbatim
 brace not to be interpreted as a macro parameter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All other characters stand for their own.
 If you like, you should be able to produce XML, HTML, JSON and other ASCII-base
d output formats this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Macro calls have the following syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
macroname
\emph default
{
\emph on
arg1
\emph default
}{
\emph on
arg2
\emph default
}{
\emph on
argn
\emph default
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, arguments may be empty, denoted as 
\family typewriter
{}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to supply more arguments than required.
 These are simply ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There must be always at least 1 argument, even for parameterless macros.
 In such a case, it is good style to leave it empty (even if it is actually
 ignored).
 Just write 
\family typewriter
%parameterlessmacro{}
\family default
 in such a case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
%{
\emph on
varname
\emph default
}
\family default
 syntax: As a special case, the macro name may be empty, but then the first
 argument must denote a previously defined variable (such as assigned via
 
\family typewriter
%let{varname}{myvalue}
\family default
, or a pre-defined standard variable like 
\family typewriter
%{res}
\family default
 for the current resource name, see later paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Predefined-Variables"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, parameter calls may be (almost) arbitrarily nested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, the 
\emph on
correctness
\emph default
 of nesting of braces must be generally obeyed, as usual in any other macro
 processor language.
 General rule: for each opening brace, there must be exactly one closing
 brace somewhere afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These rules are hopefully simple and intuitive.
 There are currently no exceptions.
 In particular, there is no special infix operator syntax for arithmetic
 expressions, and therefore no operator precedence rules are necessary.
 You have to write nested arithmetic expressions always in the above prefix
 syntax, like 
\family typewriter
%*{7}{%+{2}{3}}
\family default
 (similar to non-inverse polish notation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

When deeply nesting macros and their braces, you may easily find yourself
 in a feeling like in the good old days of Lisp.
 Use the above backslash-newline syntax to indent your macros in a readable
 and structured way.
 Fortunately, modern text editors like (x)emacs or vim have modes for dealing
 with the correctness of nested braces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calling Builtin / Primitive Macros

\begin_layout Standard
Primitive macros can be called in two alternate forms:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
%primitive-*{}
\family default
 form, you 
\emph on
explicitly disallow
\emph default
 interception of the call by a

 Otherwise, you may override the standard definition even of primitive macros

 This is for simplification of boring if-else-if chains.
 The classical if-syntax (as shown above) has the drawback that inner if-parts
 need to be nested into outer else-parts, so rather deep nestings may occur
 when you are programming longer chains.
 This is an alternate syntax for avoidance of deep nesting.
 When giving an odd number of arguments, the last argument is taken as final
 else-part.

 Like in many other macro languages, this evaluates the named macro in the
 a new scope.
 This means that any side effects produced by the called macro, such as
 variable assignments, will be reverted after the call, and therefore not
 influence the old scope.
 However notice that the arguments 
\family typewriter
\emph on

\family default
\emph default
 to 
\family typewriter
\emph on
argn
\family default
\emph default
 are evaluted in the

 if they contain some), and their result is respectively assigned to 
\family typewriter
%{1}
\family default
 until 
\family typewriter
%{
\emph on
n
\emph default
}
\family default
 in the new scope, analogously to the Shell or to Perl.
 In addition, the new 
\family typewriter
%{0}
\family default

\family typewriter
\emph on

Scripting HOWTO
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the 
\series bold
asynchronous communication model
\series default
 of MARS (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Lamport-Clock"

\end_inset

) including the Lamport clock, and the 
\series bold
state model
\series default
 (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-State-of"

\end_inset

) is something you 
\emph on
definitely
\emph default
 should have in mind when you want to do some scripting.
 Here is some further concrete advice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't access anything on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directly, except for debugging purposes.
 Use 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avoid running scripts in parallel, other than for inspection / monitoring
 purposes.
 When you give two 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands in parallel (whether on the same host, or on different hosts belonging
 to the same cluster), it is very likely to produce a mess.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 has no internal locking.
 There is no cluster-wide locking at all.
 Unfortunately, some systems like Pacemaker are violating this in many cases
 (depending on their configuration).
 Best is if you have a dedicated / more or less centralized 
\series bold
control machine
\series default
 which controls masses of your georedundant working servers.
 This reduces the risk of running interfering actions in parallel.
 Of course, you need backup machines for your control machines, and in different
 locations.
 Not obeying this advice can easily lead to problems such as complex races
 which are very difficult to solve in long-distance distributed systems,
 even in general (not limited to MARS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-cluster
\family default
 is your friend.
 Whenever your (near-)central script has to switch between different hosts
 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
B
\family default
 (of the same cluster), use it in the following way:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm action1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm wait-cluster; marsadm action2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family default

\begin_inset Graphics

	lyxscale 50

\end_inset

 Don't ignore this advice! Interference is almost 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
! As a rule of thumb, precede almost any action command with some appropriate
 waiting command!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Further friends are any 
\family typewriter
marsadm wait-*
\family default
 commands, such as 
\family typewriter
wait-umount

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In some places, busy-wait loops might be needed, e.g.

github.com/schoebel/test-suite
\family default
 in subdirectory

 or similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case of network problems, some command may hang (forever), if you don't
 set the 
\family typewriter
--timeout=

 option.
 Don't forget the check the return state of any failed / timeouted commands,
 and to take appropriate measures!

This option does not change the waiting logic.
 Many commands are waiting until the desired effect has taken place.
 However, with

 the desired effect will never happen, so the command may wait forever (or
 abort with a timeout).

, but does not destroy the usual symmetry of the symlink tree by leaving
 the other IPs intact.
 Therefore, the local node will continue fetching updates from all nodes

 As an effect, the local node will

 mirror the symlinks of other cluster members, but not vice versa.
 There is no communication from the local node to the other ones, turning
 the local node into a

 This is a feature, not a bug.
 It could be used for porst-mortem analysis, or for monitoring purposes.
 However,

deletions

\emph on
accumulate

 thousands of old symlinks over a long time.

 physical destruction of the underlying RAID,

 When communication is impossible due to network outages or bad firewall

VERY

 DANGEROUS!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
Use this only in desperate situations, and only manually.
 Don't call this from scripts.
 You are forcefully using a sledgehammer, even without 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
! The danger is that the 
\emph on
true
\emph default
 state of other cluster nodes need not be known in case of network problems
 .Even when it were known, it could be compromised by 
\series bold
byzantine failures
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
It is strongly advised to try this command with 
\family typewriter
--dry-run
\family default
 first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When combined with 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
, this command will definitely 
\series bold
murder
\series default
 other cluster nodes, possibly after a long while, and even when they are
 operating in primary mode / having split brains / etc.
 However, there is no guarantee that other cluster nodes will be 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 dead -- it is (theoretically) possible that they remain only 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
.
 For example, a half dead node may continue to write data to 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 and thus lead to overflow somewhen.

This command implies a forceful detach, possibly destroying consistency.
 
\size scriptsize
It is similar in spirit to a 
\series bold
STONITH
\series default
.
 In particular, when a cluster node was operating in primary mode (
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 being continuously in use), the forceful detach cannot be carried out until
 the device is completely unused.
 In the meantime, the current transaction logfile will be appended to, but
 the file 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be already unlinked (orphan file filling up the disk).
 After the forceful detach, the underlying disk need not be consistent (although
 MARS does its best).
 Since this command deletes any symlinks which normally would indicate the
 consistency state, no guarantees about consistency can be given after this
 
\emph on
in general
\emph default
! Always check consistency by hand!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When possible / as soon as possible, check the local state on the other
 nodes in order to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 shutdown the resource everywhere (e.g.
 to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 unuse the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
After this command, you 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 rebuild the resource under a different name, in order to avoid any clashes
 caused by unexpected resurrection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 nodes (beware of shapshot / restores on virtual machines!!).
 MARS Light does its best to avoid problems even in case the new resource
 name should equal the old one, but there can be 
\emph on
no guarantee
\emph default
 in all possible failure scenarios / usage scenarios.

In contrast to DRBD, you need not explicitly pause syncing, fetching, or
 replaying 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 (as apposed to 
\emph on
from
\emph default
) the local disk.
 These processes are automatically paused.
 As another contrast to DRBD, the respective processes will usually 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 resume after re-attach, as far as possible in the respective new situation.
 This will usually work even over 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 or reboot cycles, since the internal symlink tree will automatically persist
 all todo switches for you (c.f.
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Notice: only

 transfer operations 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 the local disk are paused by a detach.
 When another node is remotely running a sync 
\emph on
from
\emph default
 your local disk, it will likely remain in use for remote reading.
 The reason is that the server part of MARS is operating purely passively,
 in order serve all remote requests as best as possible (similar to the
 original Unix philosophy).
 In order to really stop all accesses, do a 
\family typewriter
pause-sync
\family default
 on all other resource member where a sync is currently running.
 You may also try 
\family typewriter
pause-sync-global
\family default

\size scriptsize
Note: although this sounds similar to DRBD's 
\family typewriter
drbdadm connect
\family default
, there are subtle differences.
 DRBD has exactly one connection per resource, which is associated with
 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of nodes.
 In contrast, MARS may create multiple connections per resource at runtime,
 and these are associated with the 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 host (not with 
\emph on
pairs
\emph default
 of hosts).
 As a consequence, the fetch may 
\emph on
potentially
\emph default
 occur from any other other source host which happens to be reachable (although
 the current implementation prefers the current designated primary, but
 this may change in future).
 In addition, 
\family typewriter
marsadm disconnect
\family default
 does not stop 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 communication.
 It only stops fetching logfiles.
 The symlink update running in background is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 stopped, in order to always propagate as much metadata as possible in the
 cluster.
 In case of a later incident, chances are higher for a better knowledge
 of the 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 state of the cluster.

A common misconception is when people think that they can keep their filesystem

 stopped and thus don't write any data into the filesystem.
 This is a wrong idea, because filesystems may write some metadata, like
 booking information, even after hours or days of inactivity.
 Therefore MARS insists that the device is no longer in use before any handover
 can take place.

unrelated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 secondaries step by step, until the split brain is gone.
 Don't 
\family typewriter
join-resource

 again before the split brain is gone! This way, all these replicas will
 remain consistent for now, but of course outdated (or potentially even

 In the hopefully unlikely case that you should later discover that you

 In split brain situations (when the network is OK again), this may have

 It is much better / easier to

In many case, you will not need to deal with tweaks in

 This interface allows access to some internal kernel variables of the

 This means, the values will be reset to default at

 at startup scripts.

It is mostly intendend for lines showing high packet loss.
 By using multiple TCP sockets in parallel for emulating a single logical
 connection, throughput can be significantly increased.
\end_layout

Example for setting the socket parallelism to 4:

 fullsync of a

 100GiB resource over a loaded long-distance line between Europe/Germany

 In order to compensate highly varying load at the line, all the experiments
 were repeated more than 10 times and averaged.
 Each bar shows the throughput for a particular socket parallelism.

Notice that the uplinks of the two servers are only 1 GBit/s respectively.
 When the uplink is saturated, about 100 MByte/s is the maximum possible
 peak throughput in theory.
 You can easily recognize that the peak throughput is almost reached with
 a parallelism degree of 2, but using even more sockets appears to be slightly
 counter-productive.
 One of the reasons is that more sockets will increase contention on the
 line, and thus increasing packet loss.
 Another potential reason is that higher parallelism at sockets will lead
 to higher parallelism in disk reads, in turn leading to more permutations
 of disk read positions (more 
\emph on
random
\emph default
 reads instead of purely sequential reads), which is counter-productive
 for disk readahead strategies.

The next graphics shows the same, but over a medium distance of about 50km.
 This line is even more heavily loaded with respect to the number of TCP

The rationale behind flood protected syslogging: sysadmins are usually only
 interested in the point in time where some problems / incidents / etc have
 
\emph on

 They are usually not interested in capturing 
\emph on

If you

 need complete error information, use the 
\family typewriter
*.log
\family default
 files described above, compress them and save them to somewhere else

 This bears much less overhead than filtering via the syslog daemon, or
 even remote syslogging in real time which will almost surely screw up your

 Don't rely on real-time concepts, just do it the old-fashioned batch job

\begin_layout Subsection
General Cluster Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most commonly known cluster model is called 
\series bold
shared-disk
\series default
, and typically controlled by clustermanagers like 
\family typewriter
PaceMaker
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/shared-disk-model.fig
	width 50col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The most important property of shared-disk is that there exists only a single
 disk instance.
 Nowadays, this disk often has some 
\emph on
internal
\emph default
 redundancy such as RAID.
 At 
\emph on
system
\emph default
 architecure layer / network level, there exists no redundant disk at all.
 Only the application cluster is built redundant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

 It should be immediately clear that shared-disk clusters are only suitable
 for short-distance operations in the same datacenter.
 Although running one of the data access lines over short distances between
 very near-by datacenters (e.g.
 1 km) would be theoretically possible, there would be no sufficient protection
 against failure of a whole datacenter.

\begin_layout Standard

 could theoretically be built for

 distances, from short to medium to long distances.
 However, concrete technologies of disk coupling such as synchronous operation
 may pose practical limits on the distances (see chapter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, clustermanagers must fit to the model.
 Some clustermanager can be configured to fit to multiple models.
 If so, this must be done properly, or you may get into serious trouble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people don't know, or they don't believe, that different architectural
 models like shared-disk or shared-nothing will 
\emph on
require
\emph default
 an

 type of clustermanager and/or a different configuration.
 Failing to do so, by selection of an inappropriate clustermanager type
 and/or an inappropriate configuration may be hazardous.

 Some, if not many, clustermanagers have not been designed for long distances.
 As explained in section

\begin_layout Subsection
Handover / Failover Reasons and Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a sysadmin perspective, there exist a number of different 
\series bold
reasons
\series default
 why the application workload must be switched from the currently active
 side A to the currently passive side B:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some 
\series bold
defect
\series default
 has occurred at cluster side A or at some corresponding part of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some 
\series bold
maintenance
\series default
 has to be done at side A which would cause a longer downtime (e.g.
 security kernel update or replacement of core network equipment or maintainance
 of UPS or of the BBU cache etc - hardware isn't 24/7/365 in practice, although
 some vendors 
\emph on
claim
\emph default
 it - it is either not really true, or it becomes 
\emph on
extremely
\emph default
 expensive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both reasons are valid and must be automatically handled in larger installations.
 In order to deal with all of these reasons, the following basic mechanisms
 can be used in either model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Failover
\series default
 (triggered either manually or automatically)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Handover

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Automatic triggering could be feasible for prophylactic treatments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to not confuse handover with failover at concept level.
 Not only the reasons / preconditions are very different, but also the 
\emph on
requirements
\emph default
.
 Example: precondition for handover is that 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 cluster sides are healthy, while precondition for failover is that 
\emph on
some relevant(!)
\emph default
 failure has been 
\emph on
detected
\emph default
 somewhere (whether this is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 true is another matter).
 Typically, failover must be able to run in masses, while planned handover
 often has lower scaling requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all existing clustermanagers are dealing with all of these cases (or
 their variants) equally well, and some are not even dealing with some of
 these cases / variants 
\emph on
at all
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some clustermanagers cannot easily express the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

automatic triggering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manual triggering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of an action.
 There exists simply no cluster-global switch which selects either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manual mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

automatic mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (except when you start to hack the code and/or write new plugins; then
 you might notice that there is almost no architectural layering / sufficient
 separation between mechanism and strategy).
 Being forced to permanently use an automatic mode for several hundreds
 or even thousands of clusters is not only boring, but bears a considerable
 risk when automatics do a wrong decision at hundreds of instances in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Granularity and Layering Hierarchy for Long Distances

 instance, as the term

\emph on
cluster
\emph default
manager
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggests.
 However, when running several hundreds or thousands of cluster instances,
 you likely will not want to manage each of them individually.
 In addition, failover should 
\emph on
not only
\emph default
 be 
\emph on
triggered
\emph default
 (not to be confused with 
\emph on
executed
\emph default
) individually at cluster level, but likely 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 at a higher granularity such as a room, or a whole datacenter.
 Otherwise, some chaos is likely to happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is what you probably will 
\series bold
need
\series default
, possibly in difference to what you may find on the market (whether OpenSource

 For simplicity, the following diagram shows only two levels of granularity,
 but can be easily extended to multiple layers of granularity, or to some
 concept of various

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Notice that many existing clustermanager solutions are not addressing the
 datacenter granularity at all.
 Typically, they use concepts like 
\series bold
quorums
\series default
 for determining failures 
\emph on
at cluster level
\emph default
 solely, and then immediately executing failover of the cluster, sometimes
 without clean architectural distinction between trigger and execution (similar
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

separation of concerns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between 
\series bold
mechanism
\series default
 and

 Sometimes there is even no internal software layering / modularization
 according to this separation of concerns at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

 When there is no distinction between different levels of granularity, you

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clustermanager
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also for speaking about layers dealing with higher granularity, such as
 datacenter layers, and also for long-distance replication scenarios, although
 some terminology from grid computing would be more appropriate in a scientific
 background.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please consider the following: when it comes to long-distance HA, the above
 layering architecture is also motivated by vastly different numbers of
 instances for each layer.
 Ideally, the topmost automatics layer should be able to overview several
 datacenters in parallel, in order to cope with (almost) global network
 problems such as network partitions.
 Additionally, it should also detect single cluster failures, or intermediate
 problems like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rack failure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

room failure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as well as various types of (partial / intermediate) (replication) network
 failures.
 Incompatible decisions at each of the different granularities would be
 a no-go in practice.

 However, that would be very

 Using

This is a conceptual contradiction: the reason for starting failover is
 that you want to restore availability as soon as possible, but in order
 to do so you will first

\emph default
 the availability of a particular

component
\emph default
.
 This may be counter-productive.

\begin_layout Standard
Example: when your hot standby node B does not work as expected, or if it
 works even

\emph default
 become operational again at the old side A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example method for handling a failure scenario.
 The old active side A is assumed to be no longer healthy anymore.
 The method uses a sequential state transition chain with a STONITH-like
 step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase1 Check whether the hot standby B is currently usable.
 If this is violated (which may happen during certain types of disasters),
 abort the failover for any affected resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase2 
\emph on
Try
\emph default
 to shutdown the damaged side A (in the 
\emph on
hope
\emph default
 that there is no 
\emph on
serious
\emph default
 damage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase3 In case phase2 did not work during a grace period / after a timeout,
 assume that A is badly damaged and therefore STONITH it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase4 Start the application at the hot standby B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice: any cleanup actions, such as 
\series bold
repair
\series default
 of defective hard- or software etc, are outside the scope of failover processes.
 Typically, they are executed much later when restoring redundancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice: this method is a 
\emph on
heavily
\emph default
 distributed one, in the sense that sequential actions are alternated multiple
 times on different hosts.
 This is known to be cumbersome in distributed systems, in particular in
 presence of network problems.

\begin_layout Standard
This sequential 4-phase method is far from optimal, for the following reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method tries to handle both failover and handover scenarios with one
 single sequential receipe.
 In case of a true failover scenario where it is 
\emph on
already known for sure
\emph default
 that side A is badly damaged, this method will unnecessarily waste time
 for phase 2.
 This could be fixed by introduction of a conceptual distinction between
 handover and failover, but it would not fix the following problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Before phase4 is started (which will re-establish the service from a user's
 perspective), a lot of time is wasted by 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 phases 2 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 3.
 Even if phase 2 would be skipped, phase 3 would unnecessarily cost some
 time.
 In the next paragraph, an alternative method is explained which eliminates
 any unnecessary waiting time at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above method is adapted to the shared-disk model.
 It does not take advantage of the shared-nothing model, where further possibili
ties for better solutions exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case of long-distance network partitions and/or sysadmin / system management
 subnetwork outages, you may not even be able to (remotely) start STONITH
 at at.
 Thus the above method misses an important failure scenario.

 Under certain circumstances, it can happen that system A running amok could

fencing the disk is otherwise not possible

 does not apply.
 You can interrupt iSCSI connection at the network gear, or you can often
 do it at cluster A or at the iSCSI target.
 Even commercial storage appliances speaking iSCSI can be remotely controlled
 for forcefully aborting iSCSI sessions.
 In modern times, the STONITH method has no longer such a justification.
 The justification stems from ancient times when a disk was a purely passive

For database applications where no transactions should get lost, you should

 When the network between A and B is interrupted

 the incident happens, DRBD will automatically disconnect, and MARS will

 In order to fully eliminate this possibility, you can either use DRBD and

 But in the latter case, you are introducing a SPOF at the single shared

 The former case is logically almost equivalent to shared-disk, but avoiding

\begin_layout Standard
By running the application fencing step 
\emph on
sequentially
\emph default
 (including wait for its partial successfulness such that the old side A
 can no longer be reached by any users) in front of the failover step, you
 may minimize the amount of lost data, but at the cost of total duration.
 Your service will take longer to be available again, while the amount of
 lost data is typically somewhat smaller.

 A few people might clamour when some data is lost.
 In long-distance replication scenarios with high update traffic, there
 is 
\emph on
simply no way at all
\emph default
 for guaranteeing that no data can be lost ever.
 According to the laws of Einstein and the laws of Distributed Systems like
 the famous CAP theorem, this isn't the fault of DRBD+proxy or MARS, but
 simply the 
\emph on
consequence
\emph default
 of having long distances.
 If you want to protect against data loss as best as possible, then don't
 use 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas.
 Use 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq4$
\end_inset

, and spread them over different distances, such as mixed small + medium
 + long distances.
 Future versions of MARS will support adaptive pseudo-synchronous modes,
 which will allow individual adaptation to network latencies / distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ITON method can be adapted to shared-disk by additionally fencing the
 common disk from the (presumably) failed cluster node A.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Handover Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Planned handover is conceptually simpler, because both sides must be (almost)
 healthy as a 
\emph on
precondition
\emph default
.
 There are simply no pre-existing failures to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example using DRBD, some application commands denoted as pseudo
 code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side A: 
\family typewriter
applicationmanager stop all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side A: 
\family typewriter
drbdadm secondary all

at side B: 
\family typewriter
drbdadm primary all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
applicationmanager start all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS already has a conceptual distinction between handover and failover.
 With MARS, it becomes even simpler, because a generic handover procedure
 is already built in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side A: 
\family typewriter
applicationmanager stop all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary all

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter
applicationmanager start all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hybrid Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a planned handover may fail at any stage.
 Notice that such a failure is also a failure, but (partially) caused by
 the planned handover.
 You have the following alternatives for automatically dealing with such
 cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In case of a failure, switch back to the old side A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Instead, forcefully switch to the new side A, similar to the methods described
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Failover-Methods"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar options exist for a failed failover (at least in theory), but chances
 are lower for actually recovering if you have only 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas in total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever you decide to do in what case in whatever priority order, whether
 you decide it in advance or during the course of a failing action: it simply
 means that according to the best effort principle, you should 
\series bold
never leave your system in a broken state
\series default
 when there exists a chance to recover availability with any method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, you should 
\emph on
implement
\emph default
 neither handover nor failover in their pure forms.
 Always implement hybrid forms following the best effort principle.

As a consequence,

 There is no way for preventing it! This is an

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The probability of

\begin_layout Section
Creating Backups via Pseudo Snapshots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When all your secondaries are all homogenously located in a standby datacenter,
 they will be almost idle all the time.
 This is a waste of computing resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since MARS Light is no substitute for a full-fledged backup system, and
 since backups may put high system load onto your active side, you may want
 to utilize your passive hardware resources in a better way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS Light supports this thanks to its ability to switch the 
\family typewriter
pause-replay
\family default
 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
 from 
\family typewriter
pause-fetch
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is simple: just use 
\family typewriter
pause-replay
\family default
 at your secondary site, but leave the replication of transaction logfiles
 intact by deliberately 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 saying 
\family typewriter
pause-fetch
\family default
.
 This way, your secondary replica (block device) will stay frozen for a
 limited time, without loosing your redundancy: since the transaction logs
 will continue to replicate in the meantime, you can start 
\family typewriter
resume-replay
\family default
 at any time, in particular when a primary-side incident should happen unexpecte
dly.
 The former secondary will just catch up by replaying the outstanding parts
 of the transaction logs in order to become recent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, some 
\emph on
details
\emph default
 have to be obeyed.
 In particular, the current version of MARS Light needs an additional 
\family typewriter
detach
\family default
 operation, in order to release exclusive access to the underlying disk
 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv/$res
\family default
.
 Future versions of MARS Light are planned to support this more directly,
 without need for an intermediate 
\family typewriter
detach
\family default
 operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

Beware: 
\family typewriter
mount -o ro /dev/vg/$res
\family default
 can lead to 
\series bold
unnoticed write operations
\series default
 if you are not careful! Some journalling filesystems like 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 may replay their journals onto the disk, leading to 
\emph on
binary

 differences and thus 
\series bold
destroying your consistency
\series default
 later when you re-enable

!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png

\end_inset

Therefore, you may use small LVM snapshots (only in such cases).
 Typically, 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
 journal replay will require only a few megabytes.
 Therefore you typically don't need much temporary space for this.
 Here is a more detailed description of steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm pause-replay $res

\begin_layout Chapter
MARS for Developers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized strictly top-down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a sysadmin and want to inform yourself about internals (useful
 for debugging), the relevant information is at the beginning, and you don't
 need to dive into all technical details at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a kernel developer and want to contribute code to the emerging
 MARS community, please read it (almost) all.
 Due to the top-down organization, sometimes you will need to follow some
 forward references in order to understand details.
 Therefore I recommend reading this chapter twice in two different reading
 modes: in the first reading pass, you just get a raw network of principles
 and structures in your brain (you don't want to grasp details, therefore
 don't strive for a full understanding).
 In the second pass, you will exploit your knowlegde from the first pass
 for a deeper understanding of the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you may first read the sections about general architecture,
 and then start a bottom-up scan by first reading the last section about
 generic objects and aspects, and working in reverse 
\emph on

 order (but read 
\emph on

 trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation / Politics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS is not yet upstream in the Linux kernel.
 This section tries to clear up some potential doubts.
 Some people have asked why MARS uses its own internal framework instead
 of 
\emph on
directly
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that

 (black-box principle).
 However, such bricks are not portable to other environments like userspace.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 being based on some already existing Linux kernel infrastructures like
 the device mapper.
 Here is a list of technical reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The existing device mapper infrastructure is based on 
\family typewriter
struct bio
\family default
.
 In contrast, the new XIO personality of the generic brick infrastructure
 is based on the concept of AIO (Asynchronous IO), which is a 
\series bold
true superset
\series default
 of block IO.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In particular, 
\family typewriter
struct bio
\family default
 is firmly referencing to 
\family typewriter
struct page
\family default
 (via intermediate 
\family typewriter
struct bio_vec
\family default
), using types like 
\family typewriter
sector_t
\family default
 in the field 
\family typewriter
bi_sector
\family default
.
 Basic transfer units are blocks, or sectors, or pages, or the like.
 In contrast, 
\family typewriter
struct aio_object
\family default
 used by the XIO personality can address 
\series bold
arbitrary granularity
\series default
 memory with byte resolution even at odd
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some brick 
\emph on
implementations
\emph default
 (as opposed to the capabilities of the 
\emph on
interface
\emph default
) may be (and, in fact, 
\emph on
are
\emph default
) restricted to 
\family typewriter
PAGE_SIZE
\family default
 operations or the like.
 This is no general problem, because IOP can automatically insert some translato
r bricks extending the capabilities to universal granularity (of course
 at some performance costs).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 positions in (virtual) files / devices, similar to classical Unix file
 IO, but 
\emph on
asynchronously
\emph default
.
 Practical experience shows that even non-functional properties like performance
 of many datacenter workloads are profiting from that

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The current transaction logger uses variable-sized headers at

 Although this increases 
\family typewriter
memcpy()
\family default
 load due to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

misalignment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
overall performance
\emph default
 was provably better than in variants where sector / page alignment was
 strictly obeyed, but space was wasted for alignments.
 Such functionality is only possible if the XIO infrastructure 
\emph on
allows
\emph default
 
\emph on
for
\emph default
 (but doesn't force) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mis-aligned
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 IO operations.
 In future, many different transaction logfile formats showing different
 runtime behaviour (e.g.
 optimized for high-throughput SSD loads) may co-exist in parallel.
 Note that properly aligned XIO operations bear no noticeable overhead compared
 to classical block IO, at least in typical datacenter RAID scenarios.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The AIO/XIO abstraction contains no fixed link to kernel abstractions and
 should be 
\series bold
easily portable
\series default
 to other environments.
 In summary, the new personality provides a uniform abstraction which abstracts
 away from multiple different kernel interfaces; it is designed to be useful
 even in userspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Kernel infrastructures for the concept of 
\emph on
direct IO
\emph default
 are different from those for 
\emph on
buffered IO
\emph default
.
 The XIO personality used by MARS subsumes both concepts as use case 
\emph on
variants
\emph default
.
 
\series bold
Buffering
\series default
 is an optional internal property of XIO bricks (almost non-functional property

 However, this may be undesirable in case of fatal crashes.
 Therefore, abort operations are also configurable, as well as network timeouts

) no semantic differences to local operations (built-in
\series bold
 network transparency
\series default

 There are universal provisions for mixed operation of different versions
 (
\series bold
rolling software updates
\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The generic brick infrastructure (as well as its personalities like XIO

\series bold
dynamic re-wiring / re-configuration
\series default
 
\emph on
during

 This is absolutely needed for MARS Light logfile rotation.
 In the long term, this would be useful for many advanced new features and
 products, not limited to multipathing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The generic brick infrastructure (and in turn all personalities) provide

Similar to AOP, insertion of IOP bricks for checking / debugging etc is

 MARS is

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The generic aspect orientation approach leads to better 
\series bold
separation of concerns
\series default
: local state needed by brick implementations is not visible from outside
 by default.
 In other words, local state is also 
\series bold
private state
\series default
.
 Accidental hampering of internal operations is impeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Example from the kernel: in 
\family typewriter
include/linux/blkdev.h
\family default
 the definition of 
\family typewriter
struct request
\family default
 contains the following comment: 
\family typewriter
/* the following two fields are internal, NEVER access directly */
\family default
.
 It appears that 
\family typewriter
struct request
\family default
 contains not only fields relevant for the caller, but also 
\series bold
internal fields
\series default
 needed only in 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 
\emph on
specific

 callees.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
rb_node
\family default
 is documented to be used only in IO schedulers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
XIO goes one step further: there need not exist exactly one IO scheduler
 instance in the IO stack for a single device.
 Future 
\family typewriter
xio_scheduler_{deadline,cfq,...}
\family default
 brick types could be each instantiated many times, and in arbitrary places,
 even for the same (logical) device.
 The equivalent of

rb_node

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In emergency mode, the primary will write any write requests

Notice: emergency mode means that your secondary nodes are usually in a

 state (exception: when a sync was running in parallel to the emergency
 mode, then the sync will be automatically started over again).
 You can check consistency via

 Only when a local disk shows a lower-case letter

"d"
\family default
 instead of an uppercase

"D"
\family default

 during a sync).
 When there is a dash instead, it usually means that the disk is detatched

 Please fix these problems first before believing that your local disk is
 unusable.
 Even if it is really inconsistent (which is very unlikely, typically occurring
 only as a consequence of hardware failures, or of the above-mentioned exception
), you have a big chance to recover most of the data via

 This ambiguity will be resolved in a future MARS release.
 It is however not crucial: the resolution methods for both cases are very

Hint: during the resolution process, some other resources might have gone
 into emergency mode concurrently.
 In addition, it is possible that some secondaries are stuck at particular
 resources while the corresponding primary has

 Please repeat the steps in such a case, and look for emergency modes at
 secondaries additionally.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: be patient.
 Deleting large bulks of logfile data may take a long time, at least on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In very complex scenarios, when the primary roles of different resources

 well as after secondary crashes, just by executing 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars

 Please consider to wait until your system comes up again, instead of risking
 a split brain.

When your target is syncing (like in this example), you cannot switch to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: in case the secondary is inconsistent for some reason, e.g.
 because of an incremental fast full-sync, you have a last chance to recover
 most data after forceful switching by using a filesystem check or suchalike.
 This might be even faster than restoring data from the backup.

Now your backup datacenter should continue servicing your clients.
 The final reconstruction of the originally primary datacenter works as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the damaged primary datacenter, ensure that nowhere the MARS kernel module
 is running.
 In case of a power blackout, you shouldn't have executed an automatic 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars

 anywhere during reboot, so you should be already done when all your nodes
 are up again.
 In case some nodes had no reboot, execute 
\family typewriter
rmmod mars

 everywhere.
 If 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 refuses to run, you may need to umount the

 When nothing else helps, you may just mass reboot your hanging nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the failed side, do 
\family typewriter
rm -rf /mars/resource-$mydata/
\family default
 for all those resources which had been primary before the blackout.
 Do this

only
\emph default
 for those cases, otherwise you will need unnecessary

invalidate
\family default
s later (e.g.

 In order to avoid unnecessary traffic, please do this only as far as really
 necessary.
 Don't remove any other directories.
 In particular, 
\family typewriter
/mars/ips/
\family default
 
\emph on
