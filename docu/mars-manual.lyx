 MARS

 Light is a block-level storage replication system for long distances /
 flaky networks under GPL.
 It runs as a Linux kernel module.
 The sysadmin interface is similar to DRBD

, but its internal engine is completely different from DRBD: it works with
 
\series bold
transaction logging
\series default
, similar to some database systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Therefore, MARS Light can provide stronger 
\series bold
consistency guarantees
\series default
.
 Even in case of network bottlenecks / problems / failures, the secondaries
 may become outdated (reflect an elder state), but never become inconsistent.
 In contrast to DRBD, MARS Light preserves the

order of write operations
\series default
 even when the network is flaky (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The current version of MARS Light works 
\series bold
asynchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, application performance is completely decoupled from any network
 problems.
 Future versions are planned to also support synchronous or near-synchronous
 modes.

\begin_layout Standard
DRBD has a long history of successfully providing HA features to many users
 of Linux.
 With the advent of MARS, many people are wondering what the difference
 is.
 They ask for recommendations.
 In which use cases should DRBD be recommended, and in which other cases
 is MARS the better choice?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exist 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 cases where DRBD is better than MARS.
 1&1 has a long history of experiences with DRBD where it works very fine,
 in particular coupling Linux devices rack-to-rack via crossover cables.
 DRBD is just 
\emph on
constructed
\emph default
 for that use case (RAID-1 over network).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there exist other cases where DRBD did not work as expected,
 leading to incidents and other operational problems.
 We analyzed them for those use cases, and found that they could only be
 resolved by fundamental changes in the overall architecture of DRBD.
 Therefore, we started the development of MARS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS and DRBD simply have 
\series bold
different application areas
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we will discuss the pros and cons of each system in particular
 situations and contexts, and we shed some light at their conceptual and
 operational differences.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to describe the most important problem we found when DRBD was used
 to couple whole datacenters (each encompassing thousands of servers) over
 metro distances, we strip down that complicated real-life scenario to a
 simplified laboratory scenario in order to demonstrate the effect with
 minimal means.
 The following picture illustrates an effect which is not only observable
 in practice, but is also reproducible by the MARS test suite
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The effect has been demonstrated with DRBD version 8.3.13.
 By construction, is is independent from any of the DRBD series 8.3.x, 8.4.x,
 or 9.0.x.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The simplified scenario is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DRBD is loaded with a low to medium, but constant rate of write operations
 for the sake of simplicity of the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The network has some throughput bottleneck, depicted as a red line.
 For the sake of simplicity, we just linearly decrease it over time, starting
 from full throughput, down to zero.
 The decrease is very slowly over time (some minutes, or even hours).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen in this scenario?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the actual DRBD write throughput is lower than the network bandwidth
 (left part of the horizontal blue line), DRBD works as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the maximum network throughput (red line) starts to fall short of the
 required application throughput (first blue dotted line), we get into trouble.
 By its very nature, DRBD works 
\series bold
synchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, it 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 transfer all your application writes through the bottleneck, but now it
 is impossible
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is independent from the DRBD protocols A through C, because it just
 depends on an information-theoretic argument independently from any protocol.
 We have a fundamental conflict between network capabilities and application
 demands here, which cannot be circumvented due to the 
\series bold
synchronous
\series default
 nature of DRBD.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 due to the bottleneck.
 As a consequence, the application running on top of DRBD will see increasingly
 higher IO latencies and/or stalls / hangs.
 We found practical cases (at least with former versions of DRBD) where
 IO latencies exceeded practical monitoring limits such as 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 s by far, up to the range of 
\emph on
minutes
\emph default
.
 As an experienced sysadmin, you know what happens next: your application
 will run into an incident, and your customers will be dissatisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deal with such situations, DRBD has lots of tuning parameters.
 In particular, the 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 parameter and/or the 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 parameter will determine when DRBD will give up in such a situation and
 simply drop the network connection as an emergency measure.
 Dropping the network connection is roughly equivalent to an automatic 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, followed by an automatic re-connect attempt after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds.
 During the dropped connection, the incident will appear as being resolved,
 but at some hidden cost
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By appropriately tuning various DRBD parameters, such as 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
, you can keep the impact of the incident below some viable limit.
 However, the automatic disconnect will then happen earlier and more often
 in practice.
 Flaky or overloaded networks may easily lead to an enormous number of automatic
 disconnects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens next in our scenario? During the 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, DRBD will record all positions of writes in its bitmap and/or in its activity
 log.
 As soon as the automatic re-connect succeeds after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds, DRBD has to do a partial re-sync of those blocks which were marked
 dirty in the meantime.
 This leads to an 
\emph on
additional
\emph default
 bandwidth demand
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DRBD parameters 
\family typewriter
sync-rate
\family default
 resp 
\family typewriter

\family default
 may be used to tune the height of the additional demand.
 In addition, the newer parameters 
\family typewriter

\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-fill-target
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-delay-target
\family default

\family typewriter
c-max-rate
\family default
 and friends may be used to dynamically adapt to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 situations where the application throughput 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 fit through the bottleneck.
 These newer parameters were developed in a cooperation between 1&1 and
 Linbit, the maker of DRBD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Please note that lowering / dynamically adapting the resync rates may help
 in lowering the 
\emph on
probability
\emph default
 of occurrences of the above problems in practical scenarios where the bottlenec
k would recover to viable limits after some time.
 However, lowering the rates will also increase the 
\emph on
duration
\emph default
 of re-sync operations accordingly.
 The 
\emph on
total amount of re-sync data
\emph default
 simply does not decrease when lowering 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
; it even tends to increase over time when new requests arrive.
 Therefore, the 
\emph on
expectancy value
\emph default
 of problems caused by 
\emph on
strong
\emph default
 network bottlenecks (i.e.
 when not even the ordinary application rate is fitting through) is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 improved by lowering or adapting 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
, but rather the expectancy value mostly depends on the 
\emph on
relation
\emph default
 between the amount of holdback data versus the amount of application write
 data, both measured for the duration of some given strong bottleneck.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as indicated by the upper dotted blue box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there is 
\emph on
absolutely no chance
\emph default
 to get the increased amount of data through our bottleneck, since not even
 the ordinary application load (lower dotted lines) could be transferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, you run at a 
\series bold
very high risk
\series default
 that the re-sync cannot finish before the next 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 cycle will drop the network connection again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will be the final result when that risk becomes true? Simply, your
 secondary site will be in state 
\family typewriter
inconsistent
\family default
.
 This means, you have lost your redundancy.
 In our scenario, there is no chance at all to become consistent again,
 because the network bottleneck declines more and more, slowly.
 It is simply 
\emph on
hopeless
\emph default
, by construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case you lose your primary site now, you are lost at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people may argue that the probability for a similar scenario were low.
 We don't agree on such an argumentation.
 Not only because it really happens in pratice, and it may even last some
 days until problems are fixed.
 In case of 
\series bold
rolling disasters
\series default
, the network is very likely to become flaky and/or overloaded shortly before
 the final damage.
 Even in other cases, you can easily end up with inconsistent secondaries.
 It occurs not only in the lab, but also in practice if you operate some
 hundreds or even thousands of DRBD instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that you can produce an ill behaviour 
\emph on
systematically
\emph default
 just by overloading the network a bit for some sufficient duration.

 When coupling whole datacenters via some thousands of DRBD connections,
 any (short) network loss will almost certainly increase the re-sync network
 load each time the outage appears to be over.
 As a consequence, overload may be 
\emph on
provoked
\emph default
 by the re-sync repair attempts.
 This may easily lead to self-amplifying 
\series bold
throughput storms
\series default
 in some resonance frequency (similar to self-destruction of a bridge when
 an army is marching over it in lockstep).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only way for reliable prevention of loss of secondaries is to start
 any re-connect 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 in such situations where you can 
\emph on
predict in advance
\emph default
 that the re-sync is 
\emph on
guaranteed
\emph default
 to finish before any network bottleneck / loss will cause an automatic
 disconnect again.
 We don't know of any method which can reliably predict the future behaviour
 of a complex network.

 desperately need them.

 Linbit recommends a 
\series bold
workaround
\series default
 for the inconsistencies during re-sync: LVM snapshots.
 We tried it, but found a 
\emph on
performance penalty
\emph default
 which made it prohibitive for our concrete application.
 A problem seems to be the cost of destroying snapshots.
 LVM uses by default a BOW strategy (Backup On Write, which is the counterpart
 of COW = Copy On Write).
 BOW increases IO latencies during ordinary operation.
 Retaining snapshots is cheap, but reverting them may be very costly, depending
 on workload.
 We didn't fully investigate that effect, and our experience is a few years
 old.
 You might come to a different conclusion for a different workload, for
 newer versions of system software, or for a different strategy if you carefully
 investigate the field.

When the network is restrained, an asynchronous system like MARS will continue

 Here is one point in favour of DRBD: MARS stores its transaction logs on
 the filesystem 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
.
 When the network bottleneck is lasting very long (some days or even some
 weeks), the filesystem will eventually run out of space some day.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Defending-Overflow"

\end_inset

 discusses countermeasures against that in detail.
 In contrast to MARS, DRBD allocates its bitmap 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at resource creation time.
 It uses up less space, and you don't have to monitor it for (potential)
 overflows.
 The space for transaction logs is the price you have to pay if you want
 or need anytime consistency, or asynchronous replication in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to really grasp the 
\emph on
heart
\emph default
 of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication, we
 look at the following modified scenario:

This time, the network throughput (red line) is varying
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In real life, many long-distance lines or even some heavily used metro lines
 usually show fluctuations of their network bandwidth by an order of magnitude,
 or even higher.
 We have measured them.
 The overall behaviour can be characterized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in some unpredictable way.
 As before, the application throughput served by MARS is assumed to be constant
 (dotted green line, often superseded by the solid green line).
 The actual replication network throughput is depicted by the solid green
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, a network dropdown undershooting the application demand
 has no impact on the application throughput, but only on the replication
 network throughput.
 Whenever the network throughput is held back due to the flaky network,
 it simply catches up as soon as possible by overshooting the application
 throughput.
 The amount of lag-behind is visualized as shaded area: downward shading
 (below the application throughput) means an increase of the lag-behind,
 while the upwards shaded areas (beyond the application throughput) indicate
 a decrease of the lag-behind (catch-up).
 Once the lag-behind has been fully caught up, the network throughput suddenly
 jumps back to the application throughput (here visible in two cases).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics

 Note that the existence of lag-behind areas is roughly corresponding to
 DRBD disconnect states, and in turn to DRBD inconsistent states of the
 secondary as long as the lag-behind has not been fully cought up.
 The very rough

Of course, this visualization is not exact.
 On one hand, the DRBD inconsistency phase may start later as depicted here,
 because it only starts 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the first automatic disconnect, upon the first automatic re-connect.
 In addition, the amount of resync data may be smaller than the amount of
 corresponding MARS transaction logfile data, because the DRBD bitmap will
 coalesce multiple writes to the same block into one single transfer.
 On the other hand, DRBD will transfer no data at all during its disconnected
 state, while MARS continues its best.
 This leads to a prolongation of the DRBD inconsistent phase.
 Depending on properties of the workload and of the network, the real duration
 of the inconsistency phase may be both shorter or longer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 duration of the corresponding DRBD inconsistency phase is visualized as

MARS utilizes the existing network bandwidth as best as possible in order
 to pipe through as much data as possible, provided that there exists some
 data requiring expedition.
 Conceptually, there exists no better way due to information theoretic limits
 (besides data compression).

In case of lag-behind, the version of the data replicated to the secondary
 site corresponds to some time in the past.
 Since the data is always transferred in the same order as originally submitted
 at the primary site, the secondary never gets inconsistent.
 Your mirror always remains usable.
 Your only potential problem could be the outdated state, corresponding
 to some state in the past.
 However, the

Conclusion: you can even use

traffic shaping

 on MARS' TCP connections in order to globally balance your network throughput
 (of course at the cost of actuality, but without sacrificing local data

 If you would try to do the same with DRBD, you could easily provoke a disaster.
 MARS simply tolerates any network problems, provided that there is enough
 disk space for transaction logfiles.
 Even in case of completely filling up your disk with transaction logfiles
 after some days or weeks, you will not lose local consistency anywhere
 (see section

This time, the network throughput limit (solid red line) is assumed to be
 constant.
 However, the application workload (dotted green line) shows some heavy
 peaks.
 We know from our 1&1 datacenters that such an application behaviour is
 very common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the peaks are exceeding the network capabilities for some time, the
 replication network throughput (solid green line) will be limited for a
 short time, stay a little bit longer at the limit, and finally drop down
 again to the normal workload.
 In other words, you get a flexible buffering behaviour, coping with the
 peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar scenarios (where both the application workload has peaks and the
 network is flaky to some degree) are rather common.
 If you would use DRBD there, you were likely to run into regular application
 performance problems and/or frequent automatic disconnect cycles, depending
 on the height and on the duration of the peaks, and on network resources.

Long Distances / High Latencies

In general and in some theories, latencies are conceptually independent
 from throughput, at least to some degree.
 There exist all 4 possible combinations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There exist lines with high latencies but also high throughput.
 Examples are raw fibre cables at the ground of the Atlantic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
High latencies on low-throughput lines is very easy to achieve.
 If you never saw it, you never ran interactive 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low latencies need not be incompatible with high throughput.
 See Myrinet, InfiniBand or high-speed point-to-point interconnects, such
 as modern memory busses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low latency combined with low throughput is also possible: in an ATM system
 (or another pre-reservation system for bandwidth), just increase the multiplex
 factor on low-capacity but short lines, which is only possible at the cost
 of assigned bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\emph on
internet
\emph default
 practice, however, it is very likely that high latencies will also lead
 to worse throughput, because of the 
\emph on
congestion control algorithms
\emph default
 running all over the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have experimented with extremely large TCP send/receive buffers plus
 various window sizes and congestion control algorithms over long-distance
 lines between the USA and Europe.
 Yes, it is possible to improve the behaviour to some degree.
 But magic does not happen.
 Natural laws will always hold.
 You simply cannot travel faster than the speed of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experience leads to the following rule of thumb, not formally proven
 by anything, but just observed in practice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In general, synchronous data replication (not limited to applications of
 DRBD) works reliably only over distances 
\begin_inset Formula $<50$
\end_inset

 km.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be some exceptions, at least when dealing with low-end workstation
 loads.
 But when you are responsible for a whole datacenter and/or some centralized
 storage units, don't waste your time by trying (almost) impossible things.
 We recommend to use MARS in such use cases.

Higher Consistency Guarantees vs Actuality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We already saw in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that certain types of network bottlenecks can easily (and reproducibly)
 destroy the consistency of your DRBD secondary, while MARS will preserve
 local consistency at the cost of actuality (
\series bold

\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people, often located at database operations, are obtrusively arguing
 that actuality is such a high good that it must not be sacrificed under
 any circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone arguing this way has at least the following choices (list may be
 incomplete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
None of the above use cases for MARS apply.
 For instance, short distance replication over crossover cables is sufficient
 (which occurs very often), or the network is reliable enough such that
 bottlenecks can never occur (e.g.
 because the total load is extremely low, or conversely the network is extremely
 overengineered / expensive), or the occurrence of bottlenecks can 
\emph on
provably
\emph default
 be taken into account.
 In such cases, DRBD is clearly the better solution than MARS, because it
 provides better actuality than the current version of MARS, and it uses
 up less disk resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the presence of network bottlenecks, people didn't notice and/or didn't
 understand and/or did under-estimate the risk of accidental invalidation
 of their DRBD secondaries.
 They should carefully check that risk.
 They should convince themselves that the risk is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 bearable.
 Once they are hit by a systematic chain of events which 
\emph on

In the presence of network bottlenecks, people found a solution such that

 DRBD is even drastically worse than that of MARS (in the same situation).
 It is true that DRBD provides better actuality in

 So it is difficult to judge the risks.
 Possibly a chance is inspection of DRBD messages in the syslog, but quantificat

\end_layout

 So they didn't notice that their argumentation on the importance of actuality
 may be fundamentally wrong.
 A possible way to overcome that may be re-reading section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and comparing its outcome with the corresponding outcome of DRBD in the

A common misunderstanding is about the actuality guarantees provided by
 filesystems.
 The buffer cache / page cache uses by default a

 for performance reasons.
 Even modern journalling filesystems will (by default) provide only consistency
 guarantees, but no strong actuality guarantee.
 In case of power loss, some transactions may be even

 According to POSIX

MARS' tolerance of networking problems comes with some cost.
 You will need some extra space for the transaction logfiles of MARS, residing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exact space requirements for

 depend on the

average write rate
\emph default
 of your application, not on the size of your data.
 We found that only few applications are writing more than 1 TB per day.
 Most are writing even less than 100 GB per day.
 Usually, you want to dimension

\family default
 such that you can survive a network loss lasting 3 days / about one weekend.
 This can be achieved with current technology rather easily: as a simple
 rule of thumb, just use one

 having a capacity of 4 TB or more.
 Typically, that will provide you with plenty of headroom even for bigger
 networking incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dedicated disks for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 have another advantage: their mechanical head movement is completely independen

 For best performance, attach that dedicated disk to your hardware RAID

If you are concerned about reliability, use two disks switched together

, all changes to your resource data are recorded in transaction logfiles
 residing on the 
\family typewriter

 These files are always growing over time.
 In order to avoid filesystem overflow, the following must be done in regular
 time intervals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm log-rotate all
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This starts appending to a new logfile on all of your resources.
 The logfiles are automatically numbered by an increasing 9-digit logfile
 number.
 This will suffice for many centuries even if you would logrotate once a
 minute.
 Practical frequencies for logfile rotation are more like once an hour
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Under

This determines all logfiles from all resources which are no longer needed

Switch Primary / Secondary Roles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS Light distinguishes betwenn 
\emph on

\emph on
emergency
\emph default
 switching.
 This distinction is necessary due to subtle differences in the communication
 architecture (synchronous communication vs synchronous communication, see
 sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Lamport-Clock"

\end_inset

 and

Switching the roles is very similar to DRBD: just issue the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm primary mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
on your formerly secondary node.
 Precondition is that the old primary must not use its 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device any longer.
 If that precondition is violated, 
\family typewriter
marsadm primary
\family default
 refuses to run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for this check is that we want to avoid split brain situation
 as well as we can.
 Therefore, we distinguish between 
\emph on
intended
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
emergeny
\emph default
 switching.
 Intended switching will try to avoid split brain as best as it can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the usage check for 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is based on the open count transferred from another cluster node.
 Since MARS is operating asynchronously (in contrast to DRBD), it may take
 some time our node knows that the device is no longer used at another node.
 This can lead to a race condition if you automate an intended takeover
 with a script like 
\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

umount /dev/mars/mydata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marsadm primary mydata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 because your second ssh command may be faster than the internal MARS symlink
 tree propagation (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Symlink-Tree"

\end_inset

).
 In order to prevent such races, you should use the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
on node B before trying to become primary.
 The script should look like 
\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

umount /dev/mars/mydata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Emergency Switching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the connection to the old primary is lost, we just don't know anything
 about its 
\emph on
current
\emph default
 state (which may deviate from its 
\emph on
last known
\emph default
 state).
 The following variant will skip almost all checks and tell your node to
 become primary forcefully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm primary mydata --force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may lead to split brain if the old primary continues to operate on
 its local 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device.
 Therefore, you should do this only after
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm primary
\family default
 without 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
 has failed, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
you are sure you really want to switch even when that leads to a split brain.
 Notice that in case of connection loss you might not be able to reliably
 detect whether a split brain will actually result, or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to DRBD, split brain situations are handled differently by MARS
 Light.
 When two primaries are active at the same time, each of them writes into
 different logfiles 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-B
\family default
 where the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 host is always recorded in the filename.
 Therefore, both nodes 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 run in primary mode indepently from each other, at least for some time.
 They may even 
\family typewriter
log-rotate
\family default
 independently from each other.
 However, any other secondary node gets into some problems then: it simply
 does not not know whom it should follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Split brains are detected 
\emph on
passively
\emph default
 by secondaries.
 Whenever a secondary detects that somewhere a split brain has happend,
 it just refuses to to apply any logfiles behind the split point.
 This means that its local disk state will remain consistet, but outdated
 which respect to any of the split brain versions.
\end_layout

\series default

\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 operation: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 write request is acting like a commit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The picture shows the flow of write requests.
 Let's start with the primary node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon submission of a write request on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
, it is first buffered in a 
\emph on
temporary
\emph default
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temporary memory buffer serves multiple purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It keeps track of the order of write operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, it keeps track of the positions in the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
.
 In particular, it detects when the same block is overwritten multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
During pending write operation, any concurrent reads are served from the
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the write has been buffered in the temporary memory buffer, the main
 logger thread of the transaction logger creates a so-called 
\emph on
log entry
\emph default
 and starts an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

append
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation on the transaction logfile.
 The log entry contains vital information such as the logical block number
 in the underlying disk, the length of the data, a timestamp, some header
 magic in order to detect corruption, the log entry sequence number, of
 course the data itself, and optional information like a checksum or compression
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the log entry has been written through to the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem via fsync(), the application waiting for the write operation
 at 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is signalled that the write was successful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may happen even 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the writeback to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
 has started.
 Even when you power off the system right now, the information is not lost:
 it is present in the logfile, and can be reconstructed from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the order of log records present in the transaction log defines
 a total order among the write requests which is 
\emph on
compatible
\emph default
 to the partial order of write requests issued on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that despite its sequential nature, the transaction logfile
 is typically 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the performance bottleneck of the system: since appending to a logfile
 is almost purely sequential IO, it runs much faster than random IO on typical
 datacenter workloads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reclaim the temporary memory buffer, its content must be written
 back to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydat
\family default
a somewhen.
 After writeback, the temporary space is freed.
 The writeback can do the following optimizations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
writeback may be in 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 order; in particular, it may be 
\emph on
sorted
\emph default
 according to ascending sector ´numbers.
 This will reduce the average seek distances of magnetic disks in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
when the same sector is overwritten multiple times, only the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version need to be written back, skipping some intermediate versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the primary node crashes during writeback, it suffices to replay
 the log entries from some point in the past until the end of the transaction
 logfile.
 It does no harm if you accidentally replay some log entries twice or even
 more often: since the replay is in the original total order, any temporary
 inconsistency is 
\emph on
healed
\emph default
 by the logfile application.

In mathematics, the property that you can apply your logfile twice to your
 data (or even as often as you want), is called

The basic idea of the asynchronous replication of MARS is rather simple:
 just transfer the logfiles to your secondary nodes, and apply them to their
 copy of the disk data (also called

\end_layout

 clock.
 MARS uses a special variant called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical Lamport clock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock is another almost-realtime clock which 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 run independently from the Linux kernel system clock.
 However, the Lamport clock tries to remain as near as possible to the system
 clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both clocks can be queried at any time via 
\family typewriter
cat /proc/sys/mars/lamport_clock
\family default
.
 The result will show both clocks in parallel, in units of seconds since
 the Unix epoch, with nanosecond resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are no network messages at all, both the system clock and the
 Lamport clock will show almost the same time (except some minor differences
 of a few nanoseconds resulting from the finite processor clock speed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock works rather simple: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 message on the network is augmented with a Lamport time stamp telling when
 the message was 
\emph on
sent
\emph default
 according to the local Lamport clock of the sender.
 Whenever that message is received by some receiver, it checks whether the
 time ordering relation would be violated: whenever the Lamport timestamp
 in the message would claim that the sender had sent it 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 it arrived at the receiver (according to drifts in their respective local
 clocks), something must be wrong.
 In this case, the local Lamport clock of the 
\emph on
receiver
\emph default
 is advanced shortly after the sender Lamport timestamp, such that the time
 ordering relation is no longer violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, any local Lamport clock may precede the corresponding
 local system clock.
 In order to avoid accumulation of deltas between the Lamport and the system
 clock, the Lamport clock will run slower after that, possibly until it
 reaches the system clock again (if no other message arrives which sets
 it forward again).
 After having reached the system clock, the Lamport clock will continue
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS uses the local Lamport clock for anything where other systems would
 use the local system clock: for example, timestamp generation in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
 Even symlinks created there are timestamped according to the Lamport clock.
 Both the kernel module and the userspace tool 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 are always operating in the timescale of the Lamport clock.
 Most importantly, all timestamp comparisons are always carried out with
 respect to Lamport time.

Therefrom results a fundamentally different behaviour than DRBD.
 When your DRBD primary crashed before and now comes up again, you have
 to setup DRBD again by a sequence of commands like 
\family typewriter
modprobe drbd; drbdadm up all; drbdadm primary all
\family default
 or similar.
 In contrast, MARS needs only 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 (after 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 has been mounted by 
\family typewriter
/etc/fstab
\family default
).
 The 
\emph on
persistence
\emph default
 of the symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 will automatically remember your previous state, even if some your resources
 were primary while others were secondary (mixed operations).
 You don't need to do any actions in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a previous state, no matter how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Almost) all symlinks appearing in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory tree are automatically replicated thoughout the whole cluster.
 Thus the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory forms some kind of 
\emph on
global namespace
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the symlink replication works generically, you may use the 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/
\family default
 directory in order to place your own symlink there (for whatever purpose,
 which need not have to do with MARS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid name clashes, each symlink created at node A should have
 the name A in its path name.
 Typically, internal MARS names follow the scheme 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\emph on
something
\emph default
/myname-A
\family default
, and you should follow the best practice of systematically using 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-A
\family default
 or similar.
 As a result, each node will automatically get informed about the state
 at any other node, like B when the corresponding information is recorded
 on node B under the name 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-B
\family default
 (context-dependent names).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename /usr/share/clipart/openclipart-0.18/electronics/bulb/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

Important: the convention of placing the 
\series bold
creator host name
\series default
 inside your symlink names should be used wherever possible.
 The name part is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ownership indicator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is crucial that no other host writes any symlink not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

belonging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to him.
 Other hosts may read foreign symlinks as often as they want, but never
 modify them.
 This way, your cluster nodes are able to 
\emph on
communicate
\emph default
 with each other via symlink updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although you may create (and change) your symlinks with userspace tools
 like 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
, you should use the following marsadm commands instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm set-link myvalue /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two reasons for this: first, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link
\family default
 command will automatically use the Lamport clock for symlink creation,
 and therefore will avoid any errors resulting from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system clock (as in 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
).
 Second, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file
\family default
 (which also deletes symlinks) works on the 
\emph on
whole cluster
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the difference? If you try to remove your symlink locally by hand
 via 
\family typewriter
rm -f
\family default
, you will be surprised: since the symlink has been replicated to other
 cluster nodes, it will be re-transferred from there and will be resurrected
 locally after some short time.
 This way, you cannot delete any object reliably, because your whole cluster
 (which may consist of many nodes) remembers all your state information
 and will resurrect it whenever 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to solve the deletion problem, MARS Light uses some internal deletion
 protocol using auxiliary symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/.

\family default
 The deletion protocol ensures that all replicas get deleted in the whole
 cluster, and only after that the auxiliary symlinks in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/
\family default
 are also deleted eventually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may change your already existing symlink via 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link some-other-value /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\family default
 .
 The new value will be propagated in the cluster according to a 
\series bold
timestamp comparison protocol
\series default
: whenever node B notices that A has a 
\emph on
newer
\emph default
 version of some symlink (according to the Lamport timestamp), it will replace
 its elder version by the newer one.
 The opposite does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 work: if B notices that A has an elder version, just nothing happens.
 This way, the timestamps of symlinks can only progress in forward direction,
 but never backwards in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, symlink updates made 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 via 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
 may get lost when the local system clock is much more earlier than the
 Lamport clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your cluster is fully connected by the network, the last timestamp
 will finally win everywhere.
 Only in case of network outages leading to 
\emph on
network partitions
\emph default
, some information may be 
\emph on
temporarily inconsistent
\emph default
, but only for the duration of the network outage.
 The timestamp comparison protocol in combination with the Lamport clock
 and with the persistence of the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem will automatically heal any temporary inconsistencies as soon
 as possible, even in case of temporary node shutdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meaning of the internal MARS Light symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter

\family default
 is documented in section

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes an important difference to DRBD.
 The metadata of DRBD is allocated 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
creation
\emph default
 
\emph on
time
\emph default
 of the resource.
 In contrast, the MARS transaction logfiles are allocated 
\emph on
dynamically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
runtime
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to a potential risk from the perspective of a sysadmin: what
 happens if the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem runs out of space?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No risk, no fun.
 If you want a system which survives long-lasting network outages while
 keeping your replicas always consistent (anytime consistency), you 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 dynamic memory for that.
 It is 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to solve that problem using static memory
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bitmaps used by DRBD don't preserve the 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 of write operations.
 They cannot do that, because their space is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(k)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, MARS preserves the order.
 Preserving the order as such (even when only 
\emph on
facts
\emph default
 about the order were recorded without recording the actual data contents)
 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 space where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is infinitely growing over time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, DRBD and MARS have different application areas.
 If you just want a simple system for mirroring your data over short distances
 like a crossover cable, DRBD will be a suitable choice.
 However, if you need to replicate over longer distances, or if you need
 higher levels of reliability even when multiple failures may accumulate
 (such as network loss during a 
\emph on
re
\emph default
sync of DRBD), the transaction logs of MARS can solve that, but at some
 
\emph on
cost

Throttling

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motivation: in rare cases, some users with

ssh
\family default
 access can do 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 silly things.
 For example, some of them are creating their own backups via user-cron
 jobs, and they do it every 5 minutes.
 Some example guy created a zip archive (almost 1GB) by regularly copying
 his old zip archive into a new one, then appending deltas to the new one,
 and finally deleting the old archive.
 Every 5 minutes.
 Yes, every 5 minutes, although almost never any new files were added to
 the archive.
 Essentially, he copied over his archive, for nothing.
 This led to massive bulk write requests, for ridiculous reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, your hard disks (or even RAID systems) allow much higher write
 IO rates than you can ever transport over a standard TCP network from your
 primary site to your secondary, at least over longer distances (see use
 cases for MARS in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Use-Cases-for"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it is easy to create a such a high write load that it will be
 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to replicate it over the network, 
\emph on
by construction
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we

 some mechanism for throttling bulk writers whenever the network is weaker

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 Maximum throttling will occur once this space threshold is reached, i.e.

\family default
 lies between 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_start_percent

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_rate_kb
\family default
 (readonly) Shows the current rate of exactly those requests which are actually
 throttled (in contrast to 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 requests).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_cumul_kb
\family default
 (logically readonly) Same as before, but the cumulative sum of all throttled
 requests since startup / reset.
 This value can be reset from userspace in order to prevent integer overflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_count_ops
\family default
 (logically readonly) Shows the cumulative number of throttled requests.
 This value can be reset from userspace in order to prevent integer overflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_maxdelay_ms
\family default
 Each request is delayed at most for this timespan.
 Smaller values will improve the responsiveness of your userspace application,
 but at the cost of potentially retarding the requests not sufficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_minwindow_ms
\family default
 Set the minimum length of the measuring window.
 The measuring window is the timespan for which the average (throughput)
 rate is computed (see 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_rate_kb
\family default
).
 Lower values can increase the responsiveness of the controller algorithm,
 but at the cost of accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_maxwindow_ms
\family default
 This parameter must be set sufficiently much greater than 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_minwindow_ms
\family default
.
 In case the flow of throttled operations pauses for some natural reason
 (e.g.
 switched off, low load, etc), this parameter determines when a completely
 new rate calculation should be started over
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Motivation: if requests would pause for one hour, the measuring window could
 become also an hour.
 Of course, that would lead to completely meaningless results.
 Two requests in one hour is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incorrect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from a human point of view: we just have to ensure that averages are computed
 with respect to a reasonable maximum time window in the magnitude of 10s.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 is almost full and there is really absolutely no chance of getting rid
 of any local transaction logfile (or free some space in any other way),
 there is only one exit strategy: stop creating new logfile data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the ability for replication gets lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering emergency mode, the kernel module will execute the following
 steps for all resources where the affected host is acting as a primary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logrotate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but create a 
\emph on
hole
\emph default
 in the sequence of transaction logfile numbers.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logfile is left empty, i.e.
 no data ist written to it (for now).
 The hole in the numbering will prevent any secondaries from applying any
 logfiles behind the hole (should they ever contain some data, e.g.
 because the emergency mode has been left again).
 This works because the secondaries are regularly checking the logfile numbers
 for contiguity, and they will refuse to apply anything which is not contiguous.
 As a result, the secondaries will be left in a consistent, but outdated
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kernel module writes back all data present in the temporary memory buffer
 (see figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Transaction-Logger"

\end_inset

).
 This may lead to a (short) delay of user write requests until that has
 finished (typically fractions of a second or a few seconds).
 The reason is that the temporary memory buffer must not be increased in
 parallel during this phase (race conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the temporary memory buffer is empty, all local IO requests (whether
 reads or writes) are directly going to the underlying disk.
 This has the same effect as if MARS was not present anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to leave emergency mode, the sysadmin should do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Free enough space.
 For example, delete any foreign files on 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 which have nothing to do with MARS, or resize the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem, or whatever.

\family default
 is not set, now it is time to set it.
 Normally, it should be already set.
 In consequence, the primary sides should continue transaction logging automatic
ally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the secondaries, use 
\family typewriter
marsadm invalidate $res
\family default
 in order to get your outdated mirrors uptodate.
 This will lead to temporarily inconsistent mirrors, so don't do this on
 all secondaries in parallel, but sequentially step by step.
 This way, if you have more than 1 mirror, you will always retain at least
 one consistent, but outdated copy.

If you had only 1 mirror per resource before the overflow happened, you
 can now create a new one via 
\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource $res
\family default
 on a third node (provided that your storage space permits that after the
 cleanup).
 After the initial full sync has finished there, do an 
\family typewriter
marsadm invalidate $res
\family default
 on the outdated mirror.
 This way, you will always retain at least one consistent mirror somewhere.
 After all is up-to-date, you can delete the superfluous mirror by 
\family typewriter
marsadm leave-resource $res
\family default
 and reclaim the disk space from its underlying disk.

\begin_layout Standard
Common precondition for all resource operations is that the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem is mounted, that it contains a valid MARS symlink tree produced
 by other 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 commands, that your current node is a member of the cluster, and that the
 kernel module is loaded.
 When communication is impossible due to network outages or bad firewall
 rules, most commands will succeed, but other cluster nodes may take a long
 time to notice your changes.

\size scriptsize
When another host is currently primary, it is first asked to become secondary,
 and waited for to actually be secondary.
 After that, the local host is asked to become primary.
 Before actually becoming primary, all relevant logfiles are applied.
 Only after that,

/dev/mars/$dev_name

 will appear.
 When netwrk transfers of the symlink tree are very slow (or currently impossibl

 Therefore

 will skip all checks depending on remote state.

This would cause unintended side effects due to races between logfile transfer
 / application and block-wise comparison of the underlying disks.
 However, MARS 
\family typewriter
invalide
\family default
 will do the same as DRBD verify followed by DRBD resync, i.e.
 
\family typewriter
marsadm invalidate
\family default
 will automatically correct any found errors; note that the fast-fullsync
 algorithm of MARS will minimize network traffic.

\begin_layout Chapter
MARS for Developers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized strictly top-down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a sysadmin and want to inform yourself about internals (useful
 for debugging), the relevant information is at the beginning, and you don't
 need to dive into all technical details at the end (e.g., you may stop after
 reading the documentation on symlink trees or even use that documentation
 like an encyclopedia).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a kernel developer and want to contribute code to the MARS community,
 please read it (almost) all.
 Due to the top-down organization, sometimes you will need to follow some
 forward references in order to understand details.
 Therefore I recommend reading this chapter twice in two different reading
 modes: in the first reading pass, you just get a raw network of principles
 and structures in your brain (you don't want to grasp details, therefore
 don't strive for a full understanding).
 In the second pass, you exploit your knowlegde from the first pass for
 a deeper understanding of the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you may first read the first section about general architecture,
 and then start a bottom-up scan by first reading the last section about
 generic objects and aspects, and working in reverse 
\emph on
section
\emph default
 order (but read 
\emph on
sub
\emph default
sections in-order) until you finally reach the kernel interfaces / symlink
 trees.
