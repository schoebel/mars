\begin_layout Section*
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document explains and discusses how to select the right storage architectur
e for typical use cases in big enterprises.
 Besides general storage architectures, pitfalls of geo-redundancy and long-dist
ance replication are highlighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to technical discussion, 
\series bold
cost and risks
\series default
 are treated as well, addressing some 
\series bold
management needs
\series default
 up to CTO level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to several other publications, it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 an enumeration of sheer endless possibilites and components on the market.
 It provides 
\series bold
guidance
\series default
 about the 
\series bold
structures and ideas
\series default
 
\emph on
behind
\emph default
 storage architectures and their connection to application processing.
 Particular attention is on 
\series bold
avoidance of pitfalls
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It provides both 
\emph on
technical
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
management
\emph default
 guidance about selection of architectures as well as their implementation
 
\emph on
classes
\emph default
, and also about selection of suitable component 
\emph on
classes
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it helps checking for use cases where MARS will be a good solution,
 and where other solutions will be better suited.
 It also addresses some unexpected problems when inappropriate types of
 cluster managers are selected for long-distance replication.

By intuitive explanations as well as mathematical arguments, this guide
 shows that

Permanent

\begin_layout Itemize
When applicable for a certain use case, the best architectural model is

sharding

 It can easily save a cost factor of about 2, while increasing

\series bold
architectural requirements
\series default
 for a particular 
\series bold
application area
\series default
 (typically covering 
\emph on
multiple
\emph default
 use cases), then look at 
\series bold
multiple solution architectures

, and finally go down to a 
\series bold
\emph on
set
\series default
\emph default
 of potential implementations, but only 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the former has been understood.
 Selection of components and technologies should be the 
\emph on
last
\emph default
 step during the first iteration of this method.
 Then do a 
\series bold
quality check
\series default
 at 
\emph on
concept
\emph default
 level.
 Often, this review will disguise some problems / limitations etc, which
 should be treated by further iterations, restarting top-down again.

 During this iterative concept work, you should

 Starting at the bottom with a particular single solution in mind, and/or

\emph on
guarantee
\emph default
 for a non-optimum solution, or even a failed project, or even a disaster
 at company level when 
\series bold
enterprise-critical mass data

 Always consider a

 candidate architectures, and for each of them, a

 solutions / technologies.

 Be cautious when transferring 
\emph on
software
\emph default
 development methods to storage architectures, where operations involves
 masses of hardware.
 You need to find a balance between extreme waterfall-like and agile
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Purely agile methods are less suited for quality ensurance of storage architectu
res, because they are tempting people to start with simple approaches before
 the problem domain has been fully understood, increasing the 
\series bold
risk of architectural ill-designs
\series default
.
 Starting an implementation 
\emph on
too early
\emph default
 on basis of an ill-design can easily 
\series bold
lead into a dead end
\series default
.
 Agile methods are typically encouraging 
\series bold
early deliverables
\series default
., which can be counter-productive.
 Example: it is clearly a bad idea to plan for an early deliverable for
 some petabytes of storage.
 Thus architects and managers are tempted to 
\emph on
start small
\emph default
, e.g.
 a BigCluster architecture with only 3 storage servers.
 This type of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

early deliverable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot detect any 
\series bold
scalability problems
\series default
 early enough, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "subsec:Example-Failures-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 So you are in a 
\series bold
dilemma
\series default
, whether you like it or not.
 Although you probably dislike it, the planning phase of big storage systems
 is unfortunately more like a waterfall process, by its very nature.
 Thus 
\emph on
workarounds
\emph default
 for the shortcomings of a pure waterfall model are needed.
 German readers may also check the V-model XT, as described in

 Unfortunately, the newer XT variant of the V-model is missing in the correspond
ing English Wikipedia article (retrieved autumn 2019), misleading readers
 with unfortunate opinions like the V-model being too similar to a waterfall
 model.
 Notice that the newer XT variant of the V-model, as well as some other
 variants (e.g.
 lecture notes from Professor Jochen Ludewig / University of Stuttgart),
 have adopted many ideas from the agile community, such as rework in loops
 and cycles, and thus should not be classifed as

Creation

 This creates a

 Typically, this is done at

\begin_layout Standard
Location Transparency is an extremely important and well-known 
\series bold
fundamental principle
\series default
 in Distributed Systems, and has attracted research for decades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply stated, it means that the location of an object or of a service is
 never (part of) a primary key, but any access is via a 
\emph on
logical name
\emph default
 not depending on the location.
 Thus the location may (relatively easily) change at runtime.
\end_layout

There are numerous examples where this fundamental principle is obeyed.
 Unfortunately, there are also many examples where it is violated.

Phone numbers are

 location transparent in general.

 In general, it is not possible to move to a different city while keeping
 the old stationary phone number.
 In case of mobile phones / cellphones, numbers are

more location transparent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but even there they are 
\emph on
not fully
\emph default
 location transparent: for international calls, they contain prefixes referring
 to the country, e.g +1 for US or +49 for Germany.
 In practice, it is not easily possible to permanently move from Germany
 to US, without giving up the old number after a while.
 In addition, often the 
\emph on
service provider
\emph default
 and/or the network technology (D-net vs E-net etc) may be also be encoded
 in cellphone numbers, e.g.
 somewhere as an infix, so changing the provider may have some restrictions.

In practice, location transparency is not just a boolean property.
 As explained by the cellphone example, it may have various 
\series bold
degrees
\series default
.
 In addition, it can refer to different sub-systems at different architectural
 layers.
 Some layers / some components may be (more or less) location transparent,

Reorg tasks: these can occur in all top-level architectures.
 In general, not all operations can run in realtime, by construction.

 additional storage hardware, but will also take a rather long time, implied

Only on a few old machines, which are shortly before EOL, 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/vm_name
\family default
 is exported via iSCSI and imported into some near-diskless clients.
 This is an old architectural model, showing worse reliability (more components
 which can fail), and higher cost (more hardware, more power, more rackspace,
 etc).
 Due to iSCSI, IOPS are much worse than with pure 
\family typewriter
LocalStorage
\family default
.
 Contrary to some old belief, it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 much more flexible.
 The ability for butterfly is already sufficient for rare exceptional overload
 situations, or for sporadic hardware failures.
 Since Football also works on the old iSCSI-based architecture, load balancing
 etc does not need to be done via iSCSI.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This layer is extremely important for getting the granularities right:
 typically, each xfs instance contains several millions of customer inodes
 and/or files.
 In some cases, the number can climb up to several tenths of millions.
 Reason: shared webhosting has to deal with myriads of extremely small customer
 files, intermixed with a lower number of bigger files, up to terabytes
 in a handful of scarce corner cases.

 Each of them has a publicly visible customer IP address, which is shared
 by all of its customers (typically a few hundrets up to several tenthousands
 per container).
 Upon primary handover / failover, this IP is handed over to the sister
 datacenter via BGP = Border Gateway Protocol.
 Upon Football migrations, this IP is also retained, but just automatically
 routed to a different physical network segment.

 This is a 1&1-specific proprietary solution, supporting a grand total of

 It is also organized via the Sharding principle, but based on a different

 In order to parallelize daily incremental-forever backups, several measures
 are taken.
 Among others, customer homedirectories are grouped into 49 subdirectories
 called

 in 1&1-slang.
 Both backups and restores may run in parallel, independently for each hash,
 and distributed over multiple shards.
 Hashes are thus forming an

 Conceptual separation of replication from sharding has some advantages.
 For example, control over the replication degree

 can be more fine-grained than at physical shard level.
 For example, both DRBD and MARS are supporting this, by allowing a different
 number of replicas for each logical resource.

Our sharding model does not need a dedicated storage network in general,

 Instead, it

\begin_layout Standard

Sharding architectures are extremely well suited when both the input traffic
 and the data is 
\series bold
already partitioned
\series default
.
 For example, when several thousands or even millions of customers are operating
 on disjoint data sets, like in web hosting where each webspace is residing
 in its own home directory, or when each of millions of mySQL database instances
 has to be isolated from its neighbour.
 Masses of customers are also appearing at cloud storage applications like
 Cloud Filesystems (e.g.
 Dropbox or similar).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in cases when any customer may potentially access any of the data items
 residing in the whole storage pool (e.g.
 like in a search engine), sharding can be often applied.
 The trick is to create some relatively simple content-based dynamic switching
 or redirect mechanism in the input network traffic, similar to HTTP load
 balancers or redirectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only when partitioning of input traffic plus data is not possible in a reasonabl

 (and partly even possible with MARS when restricted to the block layer)
 may have a use case.

Dimensioning of 1&1 Shared Hosting Linux (ShaHoLin)
\end_layout

\end_inset

We have dimensioned several variants of this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We are using 1U pizza boxes with local hardware RAID controllers with fast
 hardware BBU cache and ~ 10 local disks for the majority of LXC container
 instances where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small-sized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 customers (up to ~100 GB webspace per customer) are residing.
 Since most customers have very small home directories with extremely many
 but small files, this is a very cost-efficient model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Less that 1 permille of all customers have > 250 GB (up to 2TB) per home
 directory.
 For these few customers we are using another dimensioning variant of the
 same architecture: 4U servers with 48 high-capacity spindles on 3 RAID
 sets, delivering a total PV capacity of ~300 TB, which are then cut down
 to ~10 LXC containers of ~30 TB each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
(currently in planning stage) An intermediate dimensioning between both
 extremes could save some more cost, and hopefully improve reliability even
 more, due to better pre-distribution of customer behaviour.
 The so-called midclass could be dimensioned as 90 TB per 2U pizza box,
 roughly on 12 spindles.
 It would carry the customers between ~50 and ~250 GB webspace each.

For the sake of simplicity, the following more detailed model is based on
 the following assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We are looking at 
\series bold
storage node
\series default
 failures only.
 As observed from practice, this is the most important failure granularity
 for causing incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disk failures are regarded as already solved (e.g.
 by local RAID-6 or by the well-known compensation mechanisms of big clusters).
 Only in case they don't work, they are mapped to node failures, and are
 already included in the probability of storage node failures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We only look at 
\series bold
data replication
\series default
 with a redundancy degree of a relatively small 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 CRC methods are not modeled across storage nodes, but may be present 
\emph on
internally
\emph default
 at some storage nodes, e.g.
 RAID-5 or RAID-6 or similar methods, or may be present internally in some
 hardware devices, like SSDs or HDDs.
 Notice that 
\emph on
distributed
\emph default
 CRC methods generally involve very high overhead, and won't work in realtime
 across long distances (geo-redundancy).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We restrict ourselves to temporary / 
\series bold
transient
\series default
 failures, without regarding permanent data loss.
 Otherwise, the following differences between local-storage sharding architectur

 When loosing some physical storage nodes forever in a big cluster, it is
 typically all else but easy to determine which data of which application
 instances / customers have been affected, and which will need a restore
 from backup.

\begin_layout Itemize
Storage network failures (parts, or as a whole) are ignored.
 Otherwise a fair comparison between the architectures would become difficult.

 For simplicitiy of the model, one basic application storage unit equals

\begin_layout Itemize
We assume that the number of sectors / objects per storage node is

 Some examples: a logical volume of 4 TB has 1,000,000,000 sectors or object,

The problem is that sometimes more servers than average can be down, and
 sometimes less.
 Average values should not be used in the mathematical model, but exact
 ones.
 However, humans can often better imagine when provided with

Let us start the comparison with a simple corner case: plain old servers
 with no further redundancy, other than their local RAIDs.
 This naturally corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 replicas when using the DRBDorMARS architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we apply the corner case of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 replicas to both competing architectures, in order to shed some spotlight
 at the fundamental properties of the architectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the precondition of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 replicas, a failure at 
\emph on
any one

 of the

\end_inset

 servers has two possible ways to influence the downtime from an application's
 perspective:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
LocalSharding (DRBDorMARS): downtime of 1 storage node only influences 1
 application unit depending on 1 basic storage unit.
 This is the case with the DRBDorMARS model, because there is no communication
 between shards, and we assumed that 1 storage server unit also carries
 exactly 1 application unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
BigCluster: here the downtime of 1 storage node will 
\series bold
tear down more
\series default
 than 1 application unit, because any of the application units have spread
 their storage to more than 1 storage node via uniform hashing (see assumptions
 above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For ease of understanding, let us zoom into the special case 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 for a moment.
 These are the smallest numbers where you already can see the effect.
 In the following table, we denote 4 possible status combinations out of

What is the heart of the difference? While a single node failure at LocalShardin

 at BigCluster will spread to 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$

 application units, because of the uniform hashing and because we have only
 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would it help to increase both 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to larger values?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first stay at 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

, looking at the behaviour when 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The generalization to bigger redundancy degrees 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 will follow later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following graphics, the thick red line shows the behaviour for

\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

.
 Higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in[1,4]$
\end_inset

 are also displayed in different colors, but we will discuss them later.
 All lines corresponding to the same 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 are drawn in the same color.
 Notice that both the x and y axis are logscale:

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
First, we look at the red lines, corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

.
 The behaviour of the thick red line should be rather clear in double logscale:
 with increasing number of servers at the x axis, the total downtime y is
 also increasing.
 This forms a straight line in double logscale, where the slope is 1 (proportion
al to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

), and the distances between the start of the other colored lines are multiples
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/p$
\end_inset

 for the given incident probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\family typewriter
BigCluster
\family default

 Why is it converging against the dotted grey line around 
\begin_inset Formula $n=10000$

 At

\end_inset

 servers, there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent incident
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In statistical average, there is approximately 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 some server down.
 Due to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 replica, the whole cluster will then be down from a user's perspective.
 The thin dotted grey line denotes the total number of operation hours to
 be executed for each 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, so this is the limes line we are converging against for big enough 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not look nice from a user's perspective.
 Can we heal the problem by deploying more replicas 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us look at the green solid lines, correponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas.
 Why is the thin green BigCluster line also converging against the same
 dotted limes? And why is this happening around the same point, around 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx10000$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

 When you want to operate 
\begin_inset Formula $n=10000$
\end_inset

 application instances with a replication degree of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas, then you will need to deploy 
\begin_inset Formula $k\cdot n=20000$
\end_inset

 storage servers.
 When you have 20000 storage servers, in statistical average about 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 of them will be down at the same time.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 servers are down at the same time, again the whole cluster will be down
 from a user's perspective.
 Thus the green line is also converging against the grey dotted limes line,
 roughly also around 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx10000$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is the green thicker DRBDorMARS line much better?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In double logscale plot, it forms a 
\emph on
parallel
\emph default
 line to the corresponding red line.
 The distance is conforming to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/p$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the incident probability for hitting 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 members of the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 shard is 
\emph on
improved
\emph default
 by a factor of 10,000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at all the other solid lines in any color.
 All the thin solid 
\family typewriter
BigCluster
\family default
 lines are converging against the same limes line, regardless of replication
 degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and around the same 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx10000$
\end_inset

.
 Why is this the case?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because our BigCluster model as defined above will distribute 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 objects to 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 servers uniformly, there will almost always 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 some objects for which no replica is available at almost any given point
 in time.
 This means, you will almost always have a 
\series bold
permanent incident
\series default
 involving the same number of nodes as your replication degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and in turn 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of your objects will not be accessible at all.
 This means, at around 
\begin_inset Formula $x=10,000$
\end_inset

 application units you will loose almost any advantage from increasing the
 number of replicas.
 Adding more replicas will no longer help at 
\begin_inset Formula $x\geq10,000$
\end_inset

 application units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the 
\emph on
solid
\emph default
 lines are showing the probability of 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 incident, disregarding the 
\series bold

Several distributed filesystems are separating their metadata from application

 Advocates are selling this as an advantage.
 However, in terms of 
\series bold
reliability
\series default
 this is clearly a 
\series bold
disadvantage
\series default
.
 It increases the

breakdown surface

 Some distributed filesystems are even

centralizing
\emph default
 their metadata, sometimes via an ordinary database system, creating a SPOF

 In case of inconsistencies between data and metadata, e.g.
 resulting from an incident or from a software bug, you will need the equivalent
 of a

distributed 
\family typewriter

\series default

 Suchalike can easily turn into

data loss
\series default
 and other nightmares, such as node failures during the consistency check,
 for example when your hardware is flaky and produces intermitting errors.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 interdependencies
\series default
.
 Only in this case, and only then, you can take the dashed lines arguing
 with the number of inaccessible objects instead of with the number of distorted
 application units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whenever your application uses

bigger structured logical objects

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\series bold
strict consistency
\series default
, then you will get 
\series bold
interdependent objects
\series default
 at your big cluster storage layer.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Practical example: experienced sysadmins will confirm that even a data loss
 rate of only 1/1,000,000 of blocks in a classical Linux filesystem like
 
\family typewriter
xfs
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
 will likely imply the need of an offline filesystem check (
\family typewriter
fsck
\family default
), which is a major incident for the affected filesystem instance.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Theoretical explanation: servers are running for a very long time, and filesyste
ms are typically also mounted for a long time.
 Notice that the probability of hitting any vital filesystem data roughly
 equals the probability of hitting any other data.
 Sooner or later, any defective sector in the metadata structures or in
 freespace management etc will stop your whole filesystem, and in turn will
 stop your application instance(s) running on top of it.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Similar arguments hold for transient failures: most classical filesystems
 are not constructed for compensation of hanging IO, typically leading to
 
\series bold
system hangs
\series default

 Blindly taking the dashed lines will expose you to a high 
\series bold
risk
\series default
 of error.
 Practical experience shows that there are often 
\series bold
hidden dependencies
\series default
 in many applications, often also at application level.
 You cannot necessarily see them when inspecting their data structures!
 You will only notice some of them by analyzing their 
\series bold
runtime behaviour
\series default
, e.g.
 with tools like 
\family typewriter
strace
\family default
.
 Notice that in general the runtime behaviour of an arbitrary program is

 Be cautious when drawing assumptions out of thin air!

\end_inset

 Conversely, the assumption that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 unaccessible object will halt your application, might be too strong for
 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 use cases.
 Therefore, some practical behaviour may be inbetween the solid thin lines
 and the dashed lines of some given color.
 Be extremely careful when constructing such an intermediate case.
 Remember that the plot is in logscale, where constant factors will not
 make a huge difference.
 The above example of a loss rate of 1/1,000,000 of sectors in a classical
 filesystem should not be extended to lower values like 1/1,000,000,000
 without knowing exactly how the filesystem works, and how it will react

Similarities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both are concluding: the concept of Random Replication of the storage data
 to large number of machines will reduce reliability.
 When chosing too big sets of storage machines, then the storage system

Differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The USENIX paper and many other Cloud Storage approaches are 
\emph on
presuming
\emph default
 that there exists a storage network, allowing real-time distribution of
 replicas over this kind of network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, the Sharding Approach to Cloud Storage tries to 
\emph on
avoid
\emph default
 real-time storage networks 
\emph on
as much as possible
\emph default
.
 Notice that RemoteSharding and further variants (including future improvements)
 do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 preclude it, but are trying to 
\emph on
avoid
\emph default
 real-time storage network traffic.
 Instead, the load-balancing problem is addressed via 
\series bold
background data migration
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This changes the 
\emph on
timely granularity
\emph default
 of data access: while BigCluster is transferring 
\emph on
each
\emph default
 IO request over the storage network in 
\emph on
realtime
\emph default
, nothing is transferred over an external network at LocalSharding, provided
 that no migration is necessary.
 Typically, migrations are a 
\series bold
rare exception
\series default
.
 Normally, the data is already 
\series bold
close to the consumer
\series default
.
 Only in rare situations when migration is needed, local IO transfers are
 
\emph on
shifted over
\emph default
 to external migration processes.
 The outcome of a successful migration is that local IO is then sufficient
 again.

 to the consumers as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In detail, there are some more differences to the USENIX paper.
 Some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Terminology: the scatter width 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is defined (see page 39 of the paper) as: each node's data is split 
\emph on
uniformly
\emph default
 across a group of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 nodes.
 In difference, we neither assume uniformity, nor do we require the data
 to be distributed to 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 nodes.
 By using the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the USENIX paper (as well as many other BigCluster approaches) are probably
 presuming something like a distinction between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

client
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

server
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 machines: while data processing is done on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

client machine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, data storage is on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

server machine

\begin_inset Graphics

 In contrast, MARS uses the client-server paradigm at a different granularity:
 each machine can act in client role and/or in server role 
\emph on
at the same time
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
individually
\emph default
 for each LV.
 Thus it is possible to use local storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We don't disallow conventional network-centric client-server machines in
 variants like 
\family typewriter
RemoteSharding
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
FlexibleSharding
\family default
 and so on, but we gave some arguments why we are trying to 
\emph on
avoid
\emph default
 this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It seems that some definitions in the USENIX paper may implicitly relate
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

each chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, the Sharding Approach typically relates to LVs = Logical Volumes.
 Probably, LVs could be viewed as a special case of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, e.g.
 by minimizing the number of chunks in a system.
 However notice: there exists definitions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where it is the basic transfer unit.
 An LV has the fundamental property that small-granularity 
\series bold
updates in place
\series default
 (at any offset inside the LV) can be executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notice: we do not preclude further fine-grained distribution of LV data
 at lower levels, such at LVM level and/or below, but this is something
 which should be 
\emph on
avoided
\emph default
 if not absolutely necessary (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "subsec:Optimum-Reliability-from"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Preferred method in typical practical use cases: some storage servers may
 have some spare RAID slots to be populated later, by resizing the PVs =
 Physical Volumes before resizing LVs.
 Another alternative is dynamic runtime extension of SAS busses, by addition
 of external enclosures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notice that a typical local RAID system 
\emph on
is also
\emph default
 a Distributed System, according to some reasonable definition.
 Typical RAID implementations just involve SAS cables instead of Ethernet
 cables or Infiniband cables.
 Notice that this also applies to many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Commodity Hardware
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approaches, like Ceph storage nodes driving dozens of local HDDs connected
 over SAS or SATA.
 The main difference is just that instead of a hardware RAID controller,
 a hardware HBA = Host Bus Adapter is used instead.
 Instead of Ethernet switches, SAS multiplexers in backplanes are used.
 Anyway, this forms a locally distributed sub-system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The USENIX paper needs to treat the following parameters as more or less
 fixed (or only slowly changable) 
\series bold
constants
\series default
, given by the system designer: the replication degree 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and the scatter width 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, the replication degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of our Sharding Approach is not necessarily firmly given by the system,
 but can be 
\series bold
dynamically changed
\series default
 at runtime at per-LV granularity.
 For example, during background migration via MARS the command 
\family typewriter
marsadm join-resource
\family default
 is used for dynamic creating additional per-LV replicas.
 However notice: this freedom is limited by the total number of deployed
 hardware nodes.
 If you want 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 replicas at the 
\emph on
whole
\emph default
 pool, then you will need to (dynamically) deploy at least about 
\begin_inset Formula $k*x$
\end_inset

 nodes in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The USENIX paper defines its copysets on a per-chunk basis.
 Similarly to before, we might transfer this definition to a Sharding Approach
 by relating it to a per-LV basis.
 As a side effect, a copyset can then trivially become identical to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 when the definition is 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is also changed to a per-LV basis, analogously.
 In the Sharding Approach, a distinction is not absolutely necessary, while
 the USENIX paper has to invest some effort into clarifying the relationship
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and copysets as defined on a BigCluster model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Neglecting the mentioned differences, we see our typical use case (LocalSharding
) roughly equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $S=R$
\end_inset

 in the terminology of the USENIX paper, or to 
\begin_inset Formula $S=k$
\end_inset

 (our number of replicas) in our terminology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This means: LocalSharding tries to 
\emph on
minimize
\emph default
 the 
\emph on
size
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 for any given per-LV 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, which will lead to the best possible reliability (under the conditions
 described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Another parallel comes to mind: classical RAID striping has introduced
 the concept of 
\series bold
RAID sets
\series default
 since decades.
 Similarly to random replication, RAID striping is motivated by 
\emph on
load distribution
\emph default
.
 Similarly to our previous discussion, this induces some 
\series bold
cost
\series default
.
 This is not only about RAID-0 vs RAID-10 by introduction of some more replicas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Random replication is be more like RAID-01: first 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the physical disks are striped, then replicas are created 
\emph on
on top
\emph default
 of it.
 Reversing this order would be more similar to RAID-10, and could lead to
 an improvement of random replication.
 However, this would contradict to a basic idea of BigCluster, that you
 can add 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 number of storage nodes at any time.
 Instead of adding an 
\emph on
odd
\emph default
 number of OSDs, each potentially of different size, now an 
\emph on
even
\emph default
 number needs to be added for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas, or equal-sized triples for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3,$
\end_inset

etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is a general problem caused by too high stripe spreading.
 When a single striped RAID set would grow too big, reliability would suffer
 too much.
 Thus multiple smaller RAID sets are traditionally used in place of a single
 big one
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Practical example from experience: for RAID-60, a typical RAID-6 sub-set
 should not exceed 12 to 15 spindles.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is somewhat similar to copysets, when taking the spread factor 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 as analog to the RAID set size, by using objects in place of sector stripes,
 and a few other differences like using some well-known 
\emph on
stripe distribution function
\emph default
 in place of random replication.
 Compare with section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Thrashing means that more time is spent by

Saltzer found a workaround for his contemporary batch operating systems:

Now comes a conclusion: when thrashing occurs in a modern BigCluster model
 for whatever reason, the self-amplification will be likely worse than in
 a LocalSharding model, due to the following reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Overload propagation
\series default
: when some parts of the 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2})$
\end_inset

 storage network are overloaded, other parts may also become affected in
 turn, due to sharing of network resources, such as cross-traffic lines.
 Once queueing has started somewhere, it is likely to worsen, and likely
 to induce further queueing at other parts of the shared network.
 The more other parts are affected transitively, the more parts will get
 overloaded.
 So the overload, once it has started somewhere, has a higher probabilty
 for 
\emph on
spreading out
\emph default
 even to parts which were not overloaded before (self-amplification at BigCluste
r level).

Random replication of objects adds

 to the

\end_layout

Original DSM was trying to provide a strict or near-strict consistency model
 for application programmers.
 Later research then tried some weaker consistency models, without getting
 a final breakthrough for general use cases.
 BigCluster is similarly organized to DSM, but on slow 
\emph on
remote storage
\emph default
 instead of logically shared remote RAM over fast RDMA.
 Thus we can expect similar problems as observed by the DSM community, like
 
\series bold
single points of contention

 These might become even worse once they have appeared.

\begin_layout Standard
In a nutshell: 
\series bold
system stability
\series default
 under overload conditions, once they have started somewhere, is highly
 non-linear, and tends to spread
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the past, advocates of BigCluster have placed the argument that BigCluster
 can 
\emph on
equallay distribute
\emph default
 the total application load onto 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 storage servers, so a single overloaded client will get better performance
 than in a sharding model.
 This argument contains the 
\emph on
implicit assumption
\emph default
 that load distribution is behaving 
\series bold
linearly
\series default
, or close to that.
 However, Denning and Saltzer found that system reaction due to overload
 by workingset behaviour is 
\emph on
extremely
\emph default
 non-linear, and may 
\emph on
completely
\emph default
 tear down systems even when only 
\emph on
slightly
\emph default
 overloaded.
 Although there may exist some areas where the assumption of linearity is
 correct and may lead to improvements by better load distribution, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unpredictable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behaviour due to self-amplification of overload at BigCluster level may
 result in the

opposite

.
 Denning has provided a mathematical model for this, which could probably
 be transferred to modern application behaviour.
\end_layout

, and to self-amplify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, sharding models are not spreading any overload to other shards
 by definition.
 So the total availability from the viewpoint of the

 The replication traffic per shard is so low in average that until today,

Many sysadmins are running a conservative strategy: never touch a running

 These writebacks are not performance critical in reality, because the Page

 In contrast, distributed filesystems like 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 are not working asynchronously in many places, but will often schedule
 their requests 
\emph on
synchronously
\emph default
 into ordinary network queues, which form a 
\series bold
sequential bottleneck
\series default
, competing with other high-frequent filesystem operations.
 In addition, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

save
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 button triggers masses of metadata / inode updates in a short time, often
 residing in the same directory.
 Such a directory may thus form a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bottleneck.
 When suchalike competing 
\series bold
metadata updates
\series default
 are distributed via a round-robin load balancer, the problem can easily
 become critical by the 
\series bold
cache coherence problem
\series default
.
 While local filesystems can smoothen such application behaviour via the
 Dentry Cache plus Inode Cache, which also show some asynchronous writeback
 behaviour, network filesystems are often unable to deal with this performantly.

 Although DRBD has a similar sequential bottleneck at the low-frequency
 block layer by its write-through strategy into its replica, this does not

workingset behaviour

 (in both dimensions: timely and locality).

\series default
 (possibly also denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 Besides the data itself, the corresponding

dominate

 the whole story.
 Typically, critical datacenter application data is tremendously differently

 Caution! Some people think erronously that scalability would be

linearly
\emph default
 depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 However, as is known at least since the 1960s (read some ancient papers
 from Saltzer and/or from Denning), scalability is 
\series bold
never linear
\series default
, but sometimes even 
\series bold
\emph on
disruptive
\series default
\emph default
, in particular when RAM size is the bottleneck.
 IO queues and/or networking queues are often also reacting to overload
 in a disruptive fashion.
 This means: after exceeding the 
\series bold
scalability limit
\series default
 of a particular system for its particular class of applications, the system
 will very likely 
\series bold
break down

 Depending on the application class, this is often an

 By erronously

assuming

 an equal distribution (or a Gaussian distribution) instead of actually

 There is a

fundamental

 difference
\series default
 between zpools and classical RAID / LVM stacked architectures.
 Some zfs advocates are propagating zpools as a replacement for both RAID
 and LVM.
 However, there is a massive difference in architecture, as illustrated
 in the following example (10 logical resources over 48 physical spindles),
 achieving practically the

When RAID functionality is executed by zfs, it will be located at the 
\emph on
top
\emph default
 of the hierarchy.
 On one hand, this easily allows for different RAID levels for each of the
 10 different logical resources.
 On the other hand, this 
\emph on
exposes
\emph default
 the 
\series bold
physical spindle configuration
\series default
 to the topmost filesystem layer (48 spindles in this example).
 There is no easy way for replication of these 
\emph on
physical properties
\emph default
 in a larger / heterogenous distributed system, e.g.
 when some hardware components are replaced over a longer period of time
 (hardware lifecycle, or LV Football as explained in 
\family typewriter

\family default
).
 Essentially, only replication of 
\emph on
logical

 structures like snapshots remains as the only reasonable option, with its
 drawbacks as explained above.

 However, this is a short-sighted argument when it comes to

 The following enumeration is in the same order as above (item by item):

Redundant hardware RAID cards with BBU caches, each with local goldcaps

\begin_layout Enumerate
Redundant SAS cross-cabling: any head can access any device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
BBU caches are redundant and cross-coupled, similarly to RDMA.
 When SSD caches are added to both cards, you also get redundancy there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When using cross-coupled redundant cards, you automatically get redundant
 host bus interfaces (HBAs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The same story: you also get two independent RAID controller instances which
 can do RAID computations independently from each other.
 Some implementations do this even in hardware (ASICs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dito: both cards may be plugged into two different servers, thereby creating
 redundancy at control level.
 As a side effect, you may also get a similar functionality than DRBD.

There was a major incident at a German web hosting company at the beginning

 Their entire webhosting main business was running on a single proprietary
 highly redundant CentralStorage solution, which failed.
 Restore from backup took way too long from the viewpoint of a huge number
 of customers, leading to major press attention.
 Before this incident, they were the #1 webhoster in Germany.
 A few years later, 1&1 was the #1 instead.
 You can speculate whether this has to do with the incident.
 But anyway, the later geo-redundancy strategy of 1&1 basing on a sharding
 model (originally using DRBD, later MARS) was motivated by conclusions

Proprietary vs OpenSource

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, the following dimensions are orthogonal to each other:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Architecture: LocalStorage vs CentralStorage vs DistributedStorage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Licensing: Proprietary vs OpenSource
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, however, many vendors of proprietary storage systems are selecting
 the CentralStorage model.
 This way, they can avoid inter-operability with their competitors.
 This opens the door for the so-called 
\series bold
Vendor Lock-In
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, the OpenSource community is based on 
\emph on
cooperation
\emph default
.
 Opting for OpenSource means that you can 
\series bold
combine and exchange
\series default
 numerous 
\series bold
components
\series default
 with each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key OpenSource players are 
\emph on
basing
\emph default
 their business on the 
\series bold
usefulness
\series default
 of their software components for you, their customer.
 Please search the internet for further explanations from Eric S.
 Raymond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore 
\series bold
interoperability
\series default
 is a 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 in the opensource business.
 For example, you can relatively easily migrate between DRBD and MARS, forth
 and backwards, see 
\family typewriter
mars-user-manual.pdf
\family default
.
 The 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
 block devices provided by both DRBD and MARS (and by the kernel LVM2 implementa
tion, and many others 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

) can interact with zillions of filesystems, VMs, applications, and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary: 
\series bold
genericity
\series default
 is a highly desired property in OpenSource communities, while proprietary
 products often try to control their usage by limiting either technical
 interoperability at certain layers, and/or legally by contracts.
 Trying to do so with OpenSource would make no sense, because 
\emph on
you
\emph default
, the customer, are the 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 king who can 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 select and combine components.
 You can form a 
\series bold
really customized system
\series default

real needs
\series default
\emph default
, not as just promised but not always actually delivered by so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marketing drones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from commercial vendors who are actually prefering the needs of their employer
 in front of yours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another fundamental difference between proprietary software and
 OpenSource: the former is bound to some company, which may 
\emph on
vanish
\emph default
 from the market.
 Commercial storage systems may be 
\series bold
discontinued
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be a serious threat to your business relying on the value of your
 data.
 In particular, buying storage systems from 
\emph on
small
\emph default
 vendors may increase this risk
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a risk of a 
\emph on
domino effect
\emph default
: once there is a critical incident on highly redundant CentralStorage boxes
 from a particular (smaller) vendor, this may lead to major public media
 attention.
 This may form the 
\emph on
root cause
\emph default
 for such a vendor to vanish from the market.
 Thus you may be left alone with a buggy system, even if you aren't the
 victim of the concrete incident.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In contrast, bugs in an OpenSource component can be fixed by a larger community
 of interested people, or by yourself if you hire somebody for this.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenSource is different: it cannot die, even if the individual, or the (small)
 company which produced it, does no longer exist.
 The sourcecode is in the 
\series bold
public
\series default
.
 It just could get 
\emph on
outdated
\emph default
 over time.
 However, as long as there is enough public interest, you will always find
 somebody who is willing to adapt and to 
\emph on
maintain
\emph default
 it.
 Even if you would be the only one having such an interest, you can 
\emph on
hire

\end_layout

There is a surprising consequence from this: geo-redundancy is not as expensive

There exist a few use cases where DRBD is clearly better than the current
 version of MARS.
 1&1 has a long history of experiences with DRBD where it works very fine,
 in particular coupling Linux devices rack-to-rack via crossover cables.
 DRBD is just 
\emph on
constructed
\emph default
 for that use case (RAID-1 over network).
 In such a scenario, DRBD is better than MARS because it uses up less disk
 space resources.
 In addition, newer DRBD versions can run over high-speed but short-distance
 interconnects like Infiniband (via the SDP protocol).
 Another use case for DRBD is active-active / dual-primary mode, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 is appearantly not constructed for long distances.
 1&1 has some experiences on a specific short distance cluster where the
 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
DRBD
\family default
 combination scaled a little bit better than 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
, but worse than 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 (using 2 clients in both cases – notice that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 showed extremely bad performance when trying to enable active-active 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 replication between 2 server instances, therefore we ended up using active-pass
ive DRBD replication below a single 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 server).
 Conclusion: 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 < 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 < sharding.
 We found that 
\family typewriter
glusterfs
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD scalability was about 2 times better than
 
\family typewriter
NFS
\family default
 on top of active-passive DRBD, while 
\family typewriter
ocfs2
\family default
 on top of 
\family typewriter
DRBD
\family default
 in active-active mode was somewhere inbetween.
 All cluster comparisons with an increasing workload over time (measured
 as number of customers which could be safely operated).
 Each system was replaced by the next one when the respective scalability
 was at its respective end, each time leading to operational problems.
 The ultimate solution was to replace all of these clustering concepts by
 the general concept of

Active-active won't work over long distances at all because of high network

 MARS could be stacked: using DRBD on top for MARS for active-active clustering
 of

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there exist other use cases where DRBD did not work as
 expected, leading to incidents and other operational problems.
 We analyzed them for our specific use cases.
 The later author of MARS came to the conclusion that they could only be
 resolved by fundamental changes in the internal architecture of DRBD.
 The development of MARS started at the personal initiative of the author,
 first in form of a personal project during holidays, but later picked up
 by 1&1 as an official project.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DRBD is loaded with a low to medium, but constant rate of write operations
 for the sake of simplicity of the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The network has some throughput bottleneck, depicted as a red line.
 For the sake of simplicity, we just linearly decrease it over time, starting
 from full throughput, down to zero.
 The decrease is very slowly over time (some minutes, or even hours).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen in this scenario?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the actual DRBD write throughput is lower than the network bandwidth
 (left part of the horizontal blue line), DRBD works as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the maximum network throughput (red line) starts to fall short of the
 required application throughput (first blue dotted line), we get into trouble.
 By its very nature, DRBD works 
\series bold

 Therefore, it 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 transfer all your application writes through the bottleneck, but now it
 is impossible
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is independent from the DRBD protocols A through C, because it depends
 on an information-theoretic argument independently from any protocol.
 We have a fundamental conflict between network capabilities and application
 demands here, which cannot be circumvented due to the 
\series bold
synchronous
\series default
 nature of DRBD.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 due to the bottleneck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, the application running on top of DRBD will see increasingly
 higher IO latencies and/or stalls / hangs.
 We found practical cases (at least with former versions of DRBD) where
 IO latencies exceeded practical monitoring limits such as 
\begin_inset Formula $5$

 s by far, up to the range of 
\emph on
minutes

 Experienced sysadmins will know what happens next: your application will

In order to deal with such situations, DRBD has lots of tuning parameters.
 In particular, the 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 parameter and/or the 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 parameter will determine when DRBD will give up in such a situation and
 simply drop the network connection as an emergency measure.
 Dropping the network connection is roughly equivalent to an automatic 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, followed by an automatic re-connect attempt after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds.
 During the dropped connection, the incident will appear as being resolved,
 but at some hidden cost

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By appropriately tuning various DRBD parameters, such as 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
, you can keep the impact of the incident below some viable limit.
 However, the automatic disconnect will then happen earlier and more often
 in practice.
 Flaky or overloaded networks may easily lead to an enormous number of automatic
 disconnects.

What happens next in our scenario? During the

 As soon as the automatic re-connect succeeds after

connect-int

 seconds, DRBD has to do a partial re-sync of those blocks which were marked
 dirty in the meantime.

 When the network bottleneck is lasting very long (some days or even some

 In contrast to MARS, DRBD allocates its bitmap

As you can see, a network dropdown undershooting the application demand
 has no impact onto the application throughput, but only onto the replication
 network throughput.
 Whenever the network throughput is held back due to the flaky network,
 it simply catches up as soon as possible by overshooting the application
 throughput.
 The amount of lag-behind is visualized as shaded area: downward shading
 (below the application throughput) means an increase of the lag-behind,
 while the upwards shaded areas (beyond the application throughput) indicate
 a decrease of the lag-behind (catch-up).
 Once the lag-behind has been fully caught up, the network throughput suddenly
 jumps back to the application throughput (here visible in two cases).

 In addition, the amount of resync data may be smaller than the amount of

 On the other hand, DRBD will transfer no data at all during its disconnected
 state, while MARS continues its best.
 This leads to a prolongation of the DRBD inconsistent phase.
 Depending on properties of the workload and of the network, the real duration

A common misunderstanding is about the actuality guarantees provided by

 The buffer cache / page cache uses by default a

 Even modern journalling filesystems will (by default) provide only consistency

The most important property of shared-disk is that there exists only a single
 disk instance.
 Nowadays, this disk often has some 
\emph on

 At

 Only the application cluster is built redundantly.

\begin_layout Standard

 It should be immediately clear that shared-disk clusters are only suitable
 for short-distance operations in the same datacenter, or better in the
 same room / rack.
 Although running one of the data access lines over short distances between
 very near-by datacenters (e.g.
 1 km) would be theoretically possible, there would be no sufficient protection
 against failure of a whole datacenter.

Here is an example method for handling a failure scenario.
 The old active side A is assumed to be no longer healthy anymore.
 The method uses a sequential state transition chain with a STONITH-like
 step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Phase1 Check whether the hot standby B is currently usable.
 If this is violated (which may happen during certain types of disasters),
 abort the failover for any affected resources.

\begin_layout Description
Phase3 In case phase2 did not work during a grace period / after a timeout,
 assume that A is badly damaged and therefore STONITH it.

Phase4 Start the application at the hot standby B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice: any cleanup actions, such as 
\series bold
repair
\series default

 Typically, they are executed much later when restoring redundancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Also notice: this method is a

This sequential 4-phase method is far from optimal, for the following reasons:

The method tries to handle both failover and handover scenarios with one

 In case of a true failover scenario where it is

 that side A is badly damaged, this method will unnecessarily waste time
 for phase 2.
 This could be fixed by introduction of a conceptual distinction between

 Therefore, be careful with boolean algebra.
 Prefer approximation methods / optimizing methods instead.
 Always do

For some

 Under certain circumstances, it can happen that system A running amok could

 This argument is only valid for

 attached to

 In case of iSCSI running over ordinary network equipment such as routers

fencing the disk is otherwise not possible
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 does not apply.
 You can interrupt iSCSI connections at the network gear, or you can often
 do it at cluster A or at the iSCSI target.
 Even commercial storage appliances speaking iSCSI can be remotely controlled
 for forcefully aborting iSCSI sessions.
 In modern times, the STONITH method has no longer such a justification.
 The justification stems from ancient times when a disk was a purely passive

For database applications where no transactions should get lost, you should

 When the network between A and B is interrupted

 the incident happens, DRBD will automatically disconnect, and MARS will

 In order to fully eliminate this possibility, you can either use DRBD and

 But in the latter case, you are introducing a SPOF at the single shared

 The former case is logically almost equivalent to shared-disk, but avoiding

 In a truly distributed system, the famous CAP theorem is limiting your

MARS already has a conceptual distinction between handover and failover.
 With MARS, it becomes even simpler, because a generic handover procedure
 is already built in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
applicationmanager stop all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
at side B: 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
systemd
\family default
 interface of 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hybrid Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a planned handover may fail at any stage.
 Notice that such a failure is also a failure, but (partially) caused by
 the planned handover.
 You have the following alternatives for automatically dealing with such
 cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In case of a failure, switch back to the old side A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Instead, forcefully switch to the new side A, similar to the methods described
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Failover-Methods"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar options exist for a failed failover (at least in theory), but chances
 are lower for actually recovering if you have only 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replicas in total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever you decide to do in what case in whatever priority order, whether
 you decide it in advance or during the course of a failing action: it simply
 means that according to the best effort principle, you should 
\series bold
never leave your system in a broken state
\series default
 when there exists a chance to recover availability with any method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, you should

 neither handover nor failover in their pure forms.

Re-use
\series default
 means that each time something needs to be implemented, or each time some

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other words: although the

any

 later

 When re-use is executed frequently enough,

pay off rapidly

Superfluous load balancers

Reason: on SMP servers, there

 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

load balancer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The kernel and its

\series default
 can do even better than any external load balancer, by better distribution
 of physical CPUs to processes, and by exploitation of 
\series bold
shared memory
\series default
, for example shared filesystem kernel caches, such as the Dentry Cache,
 and the fscache / Page Cache.
 Exceptions would only occur when there were per-VM global bottlenecks,
 such as interdependent processes.
 For instance, it is easy to 
\emph on
misconfigure
\emph default
 Apache logfiles to become such a bottleneck.
 Just fix such misconfigurations, before claiming that SMP scalability would
 be limited.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Instead, just assign more physical resources to a single VM.
 Only when the application load is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 so high that 1 VM would fill up a hypervisor 
\emph on
completely
\emph default
, only then a load balancer 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be potentially useful.
 However, 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 check that there are enough RAM and SMP hardware threads.
 Only when state-of-the-art multi-socket CPUs with 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx128$
\end_inset

 or more CPU threads would be insufficient for a very high connection rate,
 and after tuning measures like PHP OpCache were not sufficient, a load

could

 become necessary.

 wide-area 
\emph on
distributed
\emph default
 
\series bold
input traffic partitioning
\series default
 to geo-distributed servers, in place of a central load balancer acting
 as a SPOF in a single datacenter.
 For example, source-IP based routing can partition global traffic into

 Here is a quick recap of the main parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of basic storage units.
 It is also used for the number of application units, assumed to be the
 same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the replication degree, or number of replicas.
 In general, you will have to deploy 
\begin_inset Formula $N=k*n$
\end_inset

 storage servers for getting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 basic storage units.
 This applies to any of the competing architectures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the architecture-dependent spread exponent: it tells whether a storage
 incident will spread to the application units.
 Examples: 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

 means that there is no spread between storage unit failures and application
 unit failures, other than a local 1:1 one.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 means that an uncompensated storage node incident will cause 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 application incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the probability of a storage server incident.
 In the examples at section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Reliability-Arguments-from"

\end_inset

, a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0001$
\end_inset

 was used for easy understanding, but the following formulae should also
 hold for any other 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the observational period, introduced for convenience of understanding.
 The following can also be computed independently from any 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, as long as the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 does not change over time, which is assumed.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is only here for convenience of understanding, we set it to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=1/p$
\end_inset

.
 In the examples from section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Detailed-explanation"

\end_inset

, a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10,000$
\end_inset

 hours was used.

\begin_layout Section
Formula for DRBD / MARS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need not discrimiate between a storage failure probability S and an applicati
on failure probability A because applications are run locally at the storage
 servers 1:1.
 The probability for failure of a single shard consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 nodes is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{p}(k)=p^{k}
\]

\end_inset

because all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 shard members have to be down all at the same time.
 In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Detailed-explanation"

\end_inset

 we assumed that there is no cross-communication between shards.
 Therefore they are completely independent from each other, and the total
 downtime of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 shards during the observational period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{p,T}(k,n)=T*n*p^{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
When introducing the spread exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, the formula turns into
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{s,p,T}(k,n)=T*n^{s+1}*p^{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Formula for Unweighted BigCluster
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is based on the Bernoulli formula.
 The probability that exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{k}$
\end_inset

 storage nodes out of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=k*n$
\end_inset

 total storage nodes are down is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{S}_{p}(\bar{k},N)=\binom{N}{\bar{k}}*p^{\bar{k}}*(1-p)^{N-\bar{k}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Similarly, the probability for getting 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 or more storage node failures (up to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

) at the same time is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{p}(k,N)=\sum_{\bar{k}=k}^{N}\bar{S}_{p}(\bar{k},N)=\sum_{\bar{k}=k}^{N}\binom{N}{\bar{k}}*p^{\bar{k}}*(1-p)^{N-\bar{k}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
By replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k*n$
\end_inset

 (for conversion of the x axis into basic storage units) and by introducing
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{p,T}(k,n)=T*\sum_{\bar{k}=k}^{k*n}\binom{k*n}{\bar{k}}*p^{\bar{k}}*(1-p)^{k*n-\bar{k}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
For comparability with DRBDorMARS, we have to compute the application downtime
 A instead of the storage downtime S, which depends on the spread exponent
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{s,p,T}(k,n)=n^{s+1}*S_{p,T}(k,n)=n^{s+1}*T*\sum_{\bar{k}=k}^{k*n}\binom{k*n}{\bar{k}}*p^{\bar{k}}*(1-p)^{k*n-\bar{k}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Notice that at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

 we have introduced a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the hashing effect (teardown of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 application instances by a single uncompensated storage incident) as described
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Detailed-explanation"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Formula for SizeWeighted BigCluster
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In difference to above, we need to introduce a correction factor by the
 fraction of affected objects, relative to basic storage units.
 Otherwise the y axis would not stay comparable due to different units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

, there is no difference to above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 replica, the correction factor is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(N-1)$
\end_inset

, because we assume that all the replica of the affected first node are
 uniformly spread to all other nodes, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

.
 The probability for hitting the intersection of the first node with the
 second node is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(N-1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and with a similar argument (never put another replica of the same object
 onto the same storage node) we get the correction factor as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(k,N)=\prod_{l=1}^{k-1}\frac{1}{N-l}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Hint: there are maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 physical replicas on the disks.
 For higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{k}\geq k$
\end_inset

, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{\bar{k}}{k}$
\end_inset

 combinations of object intersections (when assuming that the number of
 objects on a node is very large such and no further object repetition can
 occur execpt for the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-fold replica placement).
 Thus the generalization to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{k}\geq k$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(k,\bar{k},N)=\binom{\bar{k}}{k}\prod_{l=1}^{k-1}\frac{1}{N-l}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
By inserting this into the above fomula, we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{s,p,T}(k,n)=n^{s+1}*T*\sum_{\bar{k}=k}^{k*n}C(k,\bar{k},k*n)*\binom{k*n}{\bar{k}}*p^{\bar{k}}*(1-p)^{k*n-\bar{k}}
