On some distros / versions, udev rules for MARS are needed.

Without any udev rules, /dev/mars/mydata is created with the sticky bit set.
As a result, the device will not vanish when leaving primary state.

In turn, some commands like "marsadm secondary" will complain about that
by means of timeouts.

On other distros / versions, catch-all rules are present which _would_
prevent the sticky bit problem. However, some syntax errors prevent this.

This directory contains distro- and version-dependent stuff. I did not have
the time to fully analyze all distros / distro versions and their udev
rules.

Since I am not an expert in writing udev rules (and I just needed
a quickfix for my own work), the files in this directory should
be regarded as examples.

For example, the file 65-mars.rules should be copied to /lib/udev/rules.d/
on some newer Debian distros. OTOH, some elder Debians don't seem to
need this (but may need debian-udev.patch).

Distro maintainers should improve on this and/or provide better solutions.
